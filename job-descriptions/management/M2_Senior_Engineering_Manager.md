# Senior Engineering Manager

**Level:** M2 (Manager / Senior Manager)

## Role Overview

The Senior Engineering Manager is a proficient people leader who manages with independence and confidence. This role may involve leading a larger team (8-15 engineers), multiple smaller teams, or a team of particularly senior engineers. The emphasis is on operating effectively without significant oversight from senior leadership.

Success in this role requires handling complex people situations independently, building high-performing teams, and creating systems and practices that help teams scale. Senior Engineering Managers make sound people decisions confidently—hiring, performance management, promotions, and when necessary, terminations. They develop talent, manage organizational complexity, and deliver consistently while maintaining team health.

While management is the primary focus, Senior Engineering Managers retain technical credibility and contribute to technical direction. They provide architectural guidance, participate in significant technical decisions, and remain capable of hands-on contribution when critical situations require it.
