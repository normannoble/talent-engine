# Head of Engineering

**Level:** M3 (Director / Senior Director)

## Role Overview

The Head of Engineering is a senior leader responsible for a significant portion of the engineering organization, managing other engineering managers (M1s and M2s) and shaping how engineering operates at scale. This role reports to executive leadership and contributes directly to company strategy and direction.

Success in this role requires developing other managers into effective leaders, building organizational capability that scales, and delivering consistent results across multiple teams. Heads of Engineering shape engineering culture, establish standards and practices, and create the conditions for engineering excellence across the organization.

While operating primarily through others, Heads of Engineering maintain strategic technical judgment and the ability to engage deeply on critical technical matters. They understand architectural trade-offs, can evaluate technical strategies, and provide hands-on guidance when situations demand senior technical perspective. This technical credibility is essential for earning trust and making sound organizational decisions.
