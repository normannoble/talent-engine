# Engineering Manager

**Level:** M1 (Team Lead / Emerging Manager)

## Role Overview

The Engineering Manager is a first-level people leader responsible for building and leading a small engineering team (typically 3-6 engineers). This role marks the transition from individual contribution to people leadership, with a focus on developing foundational management skills while maintaining technical credibility.

Success in this role requires learning how to lead through others rather than through personal output. Engineering Managers at this level build trust with their teams, translate organizational goals into team objectives, and develop their management approach with guidance from senior leaders. While learning management fundamentals, they remain technically engaged—able to contribute directly when needed and provide meaningful technical guidance to their teams.

This is typically a first management role. The emphasis is on growth and development as a manager, with the expectation that mistakes will happen and learning will follow. The company invests in developing M1 managers into confident, capable people leaders.
