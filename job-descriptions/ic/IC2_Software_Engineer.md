# Software Engineer

**Level:** IC2 (Professional)

## Role Overview

The Software Engineer is a solid technical contributor who independently delivers well-scoped features and components. This role focuses on building a strong technical foundation, developing consistent execution habits, and growing toward greater independence and impact.

Success in this role requires reliable delivery of quality work, a growing understanding of how individual contributions fit into larger systems, and proactive communication about progress and blockers. Software Engineers at this level are expected to work independently on defined problems while knowing when to seek guidance on more complex challenges.

## Success Outcomes

Success in this role means achieving the following outcomes:

### Independent Execution

- Well-scoped features and components delivered from design through completion with minimal oversight
- Work that consistently meets quality standards and requires minimal rework after code review
- Reliable estimation and delivery against commitments, with early communication when timelines are at risk
- Self-directed task breakdown and execution within larger project contexts

### Technical Competence

- Code that follows team standards, is well-tested, and integrates cleanly with existing systems
- A solid grasp of core concepts and common patterns in the team's technical domain
- Growing expertise with primary tools, technologies, and frameworks used by the team
- An understanding of how individual work fits into broader systems and business goals

### Proactive Problem-Solving

- Common issues identified and resolved independently, without waiting for direction
- Blockers and risks raised before they become critical, with proposed solutions where possible
- Good judgment about when to continue independently versus when to seek guidance
- Contributions that surface problems along with potential paths forward, not just issues

### Team Contribution

- Active participation in team ceremonies, code reviews, and technical discussions
- Useful, constructive feedback provided in code reviews that helps improve team code quality
- Beginning to help onboard and support more junior engineers when opportunities arise
- Team practices strengthened through consistent, reliable execution and positive collaboration

## Required Skills

### Technical Expertise

- Proficiency in one or more programming languages with solid understanding of software fundamentals
- Working knowledge of software design principles and common patterns
- Familiarity with version control (Git), testing practices, and CI/CD workflows
- Ability to debug and troubleshoot common issues independently
- Understanding of database concepts and basic performance considerations

### Professional Skills

- Clear communication of technical work, progress, and blockers to team members
- Effective collaboration with immediate team and adjacent functions
- Good judgment about priorities and trade-offs within defined scope
- Reliable self-management, time estimation, and follow-through on commitments

### Core Competencies

- Problem-solving skills with ability to break down medium-complexity problems into manageable tasks
- Receptiveness to feedback and demonstrated growth from code review and coaching
- Curiosity and initiative in learning new technologies and improving skills

## Required Experience

### Years of Experience

- 1-4 years of professional software development experience

### Demonstrated Track Record

- Consistent delivery of quality work in a professional software development environment
- Growing independence over time, with reduced need for oversight on familiar problem types
- Positive peer feedback and collaborative working relationships

### Technical Experience

- Hands-on experience building and maintaining software in production environments
- Experience working with version control, code review processes, and team development workflows
- Exposure to testing practices and quality assurance approaches

### Education

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field—or equivalent practical experience
