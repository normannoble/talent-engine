# Associate Software Engineer

**Level:** IC1 (Associate)

## Role Overview

The Associate Software Engineer is an early-career contributor focused on learning fundamentals and building a foundation for long-term growth. This role emphasizes developing core technical skills, understanding team practices, and contributing reliably to well-defined tasks with appropriate guidance and support.

Success in this role is defined by consistent improvement, not perfection. Associate Engineers are expected to ask thoughtful questions, incorporate feedback effectively, and demonstrate growing competence over time. With structured guidance from more senior team members, they build the skills and judgment needed to take on increasingly independent work.

### Learning and Growth

- Foundational skills that are actively developing through structured guidance, practice, and feedback
- Growing competency with the team's core tools, technologies, and development workflows
- An understanding of team processes and how work gets planned, reviewed, and delivered
- Consistent improvement in both technical skills and professional judgment over time

### Reliable Execution

- Clearly defined tasks completed with appropriate quality and within expected timeframes
- Work that meets basic quality standards and team conventions, improving with each review cycle
- Proactive communication about progress, blockers, and when help is needed
- Established patterns and practices followed consistently, with growing understanding of the reasoning behind them

### Effective Learning Behaviors

- Thoughtful questions asked that demonstrate engagement, effort, and a desire to understand
- Feedback incorporated effectively, with visible growth from one review cycle to the next
- Self-awareness about knowledge gaps and appropriate judgment about when to ask for help
- Notes, documentation, and learning artifacts that support personal growth and reduce repeat questions

### Team Collaboration

- Positive contributions to team culture through curiosity, humility, and consistent effort
- Working relationships with immediate team members built on reliability and good communication
- Active participation in team meetings and ceremonies, even when still learning the context
