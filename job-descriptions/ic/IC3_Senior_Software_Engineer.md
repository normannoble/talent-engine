# Senior Software Engineer

**Level:** IC3 (Senior Individual Contributor)

## Role Overview

The Senior Software Engineer is a self-directed technical contributor who leads project-level work and multiplies team effectiveness through expertise, mentorship, and quality leadership. This role bridges the gap between execution and technical strategy—delivering high-impact work while elevating the capabilities of those around them.

Success in this role requires deep technical expertise, sound judgment in ambiguous situations, and the ability to anticipate problems before they impact delivery. Senior Engineers own significant technical areas, influence team practices, and serve as go-to resources for complex technical challenges.

## Success Outcomes

Success in this role means achieving the following outcomes:

### Technical Delivery & Quality

- Software that is well-architected, maintainable, and performs reliably under expected load—serving as a model for quality that others follow
- Significant projects delivered from ambiguous requirements to production with minimal guidance, on time, and with appropriate quality trade-offs
- A codebase with comprehensive test coverage and robust error handling that catches issues before they reach production
- Technical decisions that appropriately balance speed, quality, security, and maintainability based on business context

### Technical Leadership & Influence

- Technical standards and practices that are adopted by the team and measurably improve code quality, reliability, or developer productivity
- Technical debt and systemic issues that are identified, prioritized, and addressed proactively—before they become critical blockers
- Sound architectural decisions within area of ownership that consider downstream impacts and long-term maintainability
- A reputation as a trusted technical advisor whose judgment is sought by peers and stakeholders on complex problems

### Team Multiplication

- Junior and mid-level engineers who are growing faster because of effective mentorship, code review feedback, and knowledge sharing
- Team members who are unblocked quickly when facing technical challenges, with guidance that teaches rather than just solves
- Documentation, onboarding materials, and shared knowledge that reduce ramp-up time and tribal knowledge dependencies
- A team culture of technical excellence, continuous learning, and constructive feedback—reinforced through personal example

### Collaboration & Execution

- Cross-functional partnerships with Product, Design, and other teams that result in technically sound solutions aligned with business goals
- Technical concepts and trade-offs communicated clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, enabling informed decisions
- Reliable, predictable delivery against commitments—with early and transparent communication when circumstances change
- Active contribution to sprint planning, estimation, and retrospectives that improves team processes over time

## Required Skills

### Technical Expertise

- Deep proficiency in one or more programming languages with strong fundamentals in software architecture and design patterns
- Strong understanding of system design, including performance optimization, scalability, and reliability considerations
- Experience with modern development practices: version control (Git), CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and code review
- Working knowledge of cloud platforms, containerization, and infrastructure-as-code concepts
- Security awareness integrated into development practices—understanding common vulnerabilities and secure coding principles

### Leadership & Collaboration

- Mentorship ability—can accelerate others' growth through effective teaching, feedback, and guidance
- Clear communication of technical concepts to diverse audiences, including non-technical stakeholders
- Constructive approach to code review that improves code quality while supporting team learning

### Core Competencies

- Strong problem-solving skills with ability to navigate ambiguous requirements and make sound technical decisions
- Ownership mentality—takes responsibility for outcomes, not just assigned tasks
- Continuous learning orientation—stays current with relevant technologies and proactively shares knowledge

## Required Experience

### Years of Experience

- 4-8 years of professional software development experience

### Demonstrated Track Record

- Proven success leading significant projects from requirements through production with minimal oversight
- History of mentoring junior engineers and contributing to their professional growth
- Experience improving team practices, tooling, or processes that resulted in measurable quality or productivity gains
- Background working in agile environments with cross-functional collaboration

### Technical Experience

- Hands-on experience with the full software development lifecycle, from design through deployment and maintenance
- Experience with cloud services (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and modern deployment practices
- Familiarity with microservices architecture, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and distributed systems concepts

### Education

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field—or equivalent practical experience
