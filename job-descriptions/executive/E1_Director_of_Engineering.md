# Director of Engineering

**Level:** E1 (Director)

## Role Overview

The Director of Engineering is an executive leader who owns a significant technology domain (such as Platform, Product Engineering, Infrastructure, or Data). This role operates at the intersection of technology strategy and business outcomes, with full accountability for their domain's success.

Directors move beyond managing managers to developing future Heads of Engineering (M3s), shaping executive-level strategy, and building cross-functional partnerships with other executives. They are accountable not just for engineering excellence within their domain, but for how that domain contributes to company success.

This role represents the transition from senior management to executive leadership. Directors are members of the technology leadership team, participate in company-level strategic discussions, and represent their domain both internally and externally.
