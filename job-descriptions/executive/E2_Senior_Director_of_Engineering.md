# Senior Director of Engineering

**Level:** E2 (Senior Director)

## Role Overview

The Senior Director of Engineering is a senior executive who operates across multiple technology domains or owns critical cross-cutting concerns that span the entire engineering organization. Where Directors own specific domains, Senior Directors take a general management perspective—ensuring the whole of engineering works together effectively and aligns with company strategy.

This role serves as a close partner to the CTO, often deputizing in their absence and contributing directly to technology strategy at the company level. Senior Directors develop Directors (E1s) into future executive leaders, shape how engineering leadership operates, and represent the company's technology capabilities externally.

The shift from Director to Senior Director is primarily qualitative: from domain excellence to organizational leadership, from executive participation to executive partnership, and from developing senior managers to developing fellow executives.
