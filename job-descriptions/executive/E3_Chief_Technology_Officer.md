# Chief Technology Officer

**Level:** E3 (Chief Technology Officer)

## Role Overview

The Chief Technology Officer is the senior-most technology executive, with ultimate accountability for the company's technology strategy, engineering organization, and technical capabilities. The CTO serves on the executive team as a peer to the CEO, CFO, and other C-level leaders, and represents technology to the board of directors, investors, customers, and the broader industry.

This role requires balancing multiple dimensions: setting technical vision while enabling execution, building organizational capability while delivering near-term results, and maintaining strategic perspective while staying grounded in technical reality. The CTO is both architect of the company's technology future and steward of its current capabilities.

As a hired executive, the CTO brings external perspective and professional excellence to the role—building on the company's foundation while introducing practices, standards, and capabilities that position it for continued growth. The CTO develops the executive leadership bench within technology, ensuring the organization's success isn't dependent on any single leader.
