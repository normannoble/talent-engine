# 30-60-90 Day Onboarding Framework

## Overview

This framework provides structured onboarding plans tailored to each level. The first 90 days are critical for new hire success—they set expectations, build relationships, and establish the foundation for long-term contribution.

**Why Level-Specific Onboarding?**

What a new IC1 needs to learn is fundamentally different from what a new E2 needs. Level-specific onboarding ensures:
- Appropriate scope and expectations from day one
- Relevant relationships and stakeholders identified
- Right level of autonomy and support
- Clear milestones for early success

## Framework Philosophy

### The Three Phases

| Phase | Focus | Theme |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Days 1-30** | Learn | Absorb context, build relationships, understand the landscape |
| **Days 31-60** | Contribute | Start delivering value, deepen knowledge, identify opportunities |
| **Days 61-90** | Own | Take full ownership, demonstrate level-appropriate impact, set trajectory |

### Guiding Principles

**1. Context Before Contribution**
New hires need to understand how things work before they can improve them. Resist the urge to "prove yourself" too quickly.

**2. Relationships Are Infrastructure**
The relationships built in the first 90 days become the foundation for everything else. Prioritize 1:1s and connections.

**3. Early Wins Build Confidence**
Structure opportunities for success. Early wins—even small ones—build confidence and credibility.

**4. Expectations Scale with Level**
An IC1 delivering a small bug fix in week 2 is great. An E1 should be assessing their entire domain by then. Calibrate expectations appropriately.

**5. Feedback Is a Gift**
Proactively seek feedback. Don't wait 90 days to learn you're off track.

## Using This Framework

### For Managers

**Before Day 1:**
- [ ] Review the level-specific onboarding guide
- [ ] Prepare onboarding materials (accounts, access, equipment)
- [ ] Schedule key 1:1s and introductions
- [ ] Identify an onboarding buddy (peer at similar level)
- [ ] Plan first-week schedule
- [ ] Prepare initial projects/tasks appropriate to level

**During Onboarding:**
- [ ] Meet frequently (daily in week 1, then 2-3x weekly)
- [ ] Provide context proactively—don't make them guess
- [ ] Give early, specific feedback
- [ ] Check in on relationships being built
- [ ] Adjust pace based on their progress
- [ ] Celebrate early wins

**At Key Milestones:**
- [ ] 30-day check-in: How is learning going? What's unclear?
- [ ] 60-day check-in: How is contribution going? What support is needed?
- [ ] 90-day review: Formal assessment of onboarding success

### For New Hires

**Your Job in the First 90 Days:**
1. **Learn aggressively:** Ask questions, take notes, seek context
2. **Build relationships:** Meet people across the organization
3. **Deliver early:** Find opportunities to contribute, even small ones
4. **Seek feedback:** Don't wait—ask how you're doing
5. **Communicate:** Keep your manager informed of progress and blockers

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Trying to change everything immediately
- Not asking enough questions (fear of looking dumb)
- Isolating yourself / not meeting people
- Over-committing before understanding capacity
- Waiting for perfect information before acting
