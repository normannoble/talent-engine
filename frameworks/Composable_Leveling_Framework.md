# Composable Leveling Framework

## Core Philosophy

**Seniority is multi-dimensional.** Individual Contributor (IC) capability and Management capability are independent skills that compose together. Every role is expressed as **ICxMy** where:
- **x** = Individual Contributor level (1-5)
- **y** = Management level (0-3)

This creates clarity about expectations, enables flexible career paths, and prevents the false choice between "technical" and "management" tracks.

## Management Levels (M0-M3)

Management levels measure people leadership capability and effectiveness, not organizational scale. Like IC levels, they follow a progression of learning â†’ doing â†’ teaching. Scale (team size, organizational complexity) is a context factor that influences the difficulty of operating at each level, but does not define the level itself.

### **M0: Individual Contributor (No Management)**
**Scope**: No direct reports or management responsibility  
**Autonomy**: Self-management only  
**Impact**: Personal contribution and informal influence  

**Characteristics**:
- Focuses on personal execution and technical/domain work
- May provide mentorship but without formal authority
- Not responsible for performance management or hiring decisions
- Not accountable for team outcomes or resource allocation

---

### **M1: Learning Management**
**Capability Focus**: Learning the fundamentals of people management  
**Development Stage**: First-time manager or early in management journey  
**Primary Challenge**: Building foundational management skills  

**Characteristics**:

- Needs regular coaching and guidance from their own manager
- Making mistakes and learning from them in a supported environment
- Translating organizational goals into team objectives
- Developing their management style and approach
- Handles straightforward people situations; escalates complex issues
- Still learning to balance IC work (if applicable) with management responsibilities

**Scale Context**:
- *Typically* manages a single team (3-8 people)

- IC2M1: Less common but valid - developing IC skills while learning management

---

### **M2: Proficient Management**
**Capability Focus**: Independently effective at people management  
**Development Stage**: Experienced manager operating with autonomy  
**Primary Challenge**: Building high-performing teams and handling complexity

### **M3: Teaching Management**
**Capability Focus**: Develops other managers and shapes management culture  
**Development Stage**: Recognized management expert who multiplies through others  
**Primary Challenge**: Building management capability across the organization  

**Characteristics**:

## Scale as a Context Factor

**Scale influences difficulty, but doesn't define the level.**

The same M2 manager might operate in different contexts:
- **Small scale, high complexity**: Managing 6 exceptionally senior ICs (IC4-IC5) requires deep management capability
- **Large scale, standard complexity**: Managing 20 people across 3 teams requires different skills but similar capability
- **Manager of managers**: Managing 3 M1 managers (15 people total) requires teaching capability (might be M2 or M3)

**Examples**:

**Scenario 1**: Manager with 5 direct reports, all IC4-IC5 senior engineers
- If learning to manage: **M1** (small scale, but learning fundamentals)
- If managing effectively and independently: **M2** (proficient despite small team)
- If developing other managers and shaping engineering management culture: **M3** (teaching through example and influence)

**Scenario 2**: Director managing 40 people across 4 teams with 4 managers reporting
- If struggling with manager-of-managers complexity: **M1** (learning at this scale)
- If operating effectively but not yet developing managers: **M2** (proficient execution)
- If coaching those 4 managers to excellence and shaping how management works: **M3** (teaching)

**Key Insight**: A startup CTO managing 8 people can be M3 if they're teaching management excellence and shaping how the company does management. A director managing 40 people might be M2 if they're executing well but not yet developing other managers.

## Composition Rules & Patterns

### Valid Combinations

**Not all combinations make sense.** Some patterns are common, others are rare, and some are typically invalid:

#### Common & Expected Patterns
- **IC1M0**: Interns, new grads, junior roles
- **IC2M0**: Standard ICs
- **IC3M0**: Senior ICs
- **IC3M1**: Early managers maintaining technical work
- **IC4M0**: Staff/Principal ICs (pure technical track)
- **IC4M1**: Tech Lead Managers
- **IC4M2**: Technical Directors
- **IC5M0**: Senior Staff/Distinguished ICs (pure technical track)

#### Rare But Valid Patterns
- **IC5M1**: Very senior IC who manages a small team (e.g., research team lead)
- **IC5M2**: Highly technical director (specialized roles)
- **IC5M3**: Technical executive with deep expertise

#### Typically Invalid Patterns
- **IC1M1+**: Cannot manage others while still learning basics
- **IC2M2+**: Insufficient expertise to lead at scale
- **IC1-2 M3**: Cannot be executive without foundational skills

### Progression Patterns

People can progress along either or both dimensions:

**Pure IC Growth**
```
IC2M0 â†’ IC3M0 â†’ IC4M0 â†’ IC5M0
```

**IC + Management Growth**
```
IC3M0 â†’ IC3M1 â†’ IC4M1 â†’ IC4M2 â†’ IC5M2
```

**Management Focus with IC Maintenance**
```
IC3M0 â†’ IC3M1 â†’ IC3M2 â†’ IC4M2 â†’ IC4M3
```

**Lateral Moves (Valid)**
```
IC4M0 â†’ IC4M1 (adding management)
IC3M1 â†’ IC4M0 (focusing on technical depth)
IC4M2 â†’ IC5M1 (smaller scope, deeper technical)
```
