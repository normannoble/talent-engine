# Job Descriptions vs. Job Ads: A Critical Distinction

## The Problem

Job Descriptions and Job Ads are frequently confused or treated as the same artifact. This confusion leads to:
- Job descriptions that fail to provide role clarity
- Job ads that fail to attract candidates
- Misaligned expectations between hiring managers and candidates
- Poor onboarding experiences when reality doesn't match the marketing

**They are fundamentally different artifacts serving different purposes.**

## Job Description: The Internal Success Document

### Purpose
Define what success looks like in the role and provide ongoing clarity for performance, development, and alignment.

### Primary Audience
- The person in the role
- Their direct manager
- HR/People Operations (for performance management, career development, compensation)

### Lifespan
**Long-running and evergreen.** Should be a living document that:
- Exists before hiring begins
- Guides the interview process
- Serves as the foundation for onboarding
- Remains relevant throughout the employee's tenure
- Evolves as the role matures but maintains core structure

### Key Characteristics
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all dimensions of success
- **Outcome-focused**: Describes desired end states, not task lists
- **Specific**: Clear enough to eliminate ambiguity about expectations
- **Structured**: Organized for clarity and reference
- **Measurable**: Success can be objectively evaluated
- **Internal-facing**: Assumes context and organizational knowledge

### Content Focus
- Role purpose and strategic importance
- Success outcomes (what "good" looks like)
- Required skills and competencies
- Required experience and background
- Relationship to other roles
- Decision-making authority and scope

### Example Language
> "Security strategies and policies that are clearly communicated, adopted across teams, and effectively protect company assets while enabling business velocity."

## Job Ad: The External Marketing Document

### Purpose
Attract qualified candidates to apply for the role and generate excitement about the opportunity.

### Primary Audience
- External job seekers (who know nothing about your company/context)
- Passive candidates (who need to be convinced to explore)
- Recruiting partners and referral sources

### Lifespan
**Temporary.** Exists only during active hiring:
- Created when hiring opens
- Retired when position is filled
- May be recreated differently if the role reopens

### Key Characteristics
- **Compelling**: Grabs attention and generates interest
- **Concise**: Respects that candidates are scanning many opportunities
- **Selective**: Highlights the most exciting and differentiating aspects
- **Accessible**: No assumed knowledge; explains context
- **Persuasive**: Sells the opportunity, team, mission, and impact
- **External-facing**: Competes in a noisy talent market

### Content Focus
- Why this role matters (the mission)
- What makes this opportunity unique or exciting
- 3-5 key responsibilities or impact areas
- Must-have qualifications (essential only)
- What the candidate will gain (growth, learning, impact)
- Company culture and values
- Compensation range (increasingly expected)

### Example Language
> "You'll shape our security strategy from the ground up, working directly with engineering leaders to build a security-first culture in a fast-growing startup. This is a rare opportunity to define best practices rather than inherit legacy constraints."

## The Relationship Between Them

```
Job Description â†’ informs â†’ Job Ad
(comprehensive)              (highlights)

Job Description â†’ guides â†’ Interview Process
(success criteria)          (evaluation framework)

Job Description â†’ anchors â†’ Onboarding
(expectations)              (first 90 days)

Job Description â†’ enables â†’ Performance Management
(outcomes)                  (evaluation)
```

### Creating a Job Ad from a Job Description

1. **Extract**: Pull the 3-5 most compelling outcomes and responsibilities
2. **Translate**: Convert internal language to external, exciting language
3. **Add Context**: Explain why someone would want this role
4. **Simplify Requirements**: Focus on truly essential qualifications only
5. **Include Selling Points**: Team culture, growth opportunity, mission, impact
6. **Call to Action**: Clear next steps for interested candidates

### Example Transformation

**Job Description (Internal):**
> A high-performing team that consistently delivers quality work and meets commitments, with team members who are developing their skills, growing in their careers, and engaged in their work.

**Job Ad (External):**
> Build and lead a team of talented engineers who will solve some of our most complex technical challenges. You'll have the opportunity to mentor emerging leaders and shape team culture from day one.

## Red Flags

**Signs you're confusing them:**

- Your "job description" reads like a marketing brochure
- Your "job ad" is 3+ pages of dense requirements
- New hires say "this isn't what I expected"
- You can't use the document for performance reviews
- Candidates are confused about what the role actually does
- Managers and employees disagree on priorities
- The document gets rewritten for every hire

## The Bottom Line

**Job Description = Success Manual**  
*"Here's how to be successful in this role, evaluated over time"*

**Job Ad = Attraction Campaign**  
*"Here's why you should be excited about this opportunity right now"*

Both are essential. Neither can replace the other.
