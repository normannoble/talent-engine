# Traditional Leveling Framework

## Purpose & Philosophy

The Traditional Leveling Framework provides a complete, standalone career framework using conventional level structures. Unlike the Composable Framework (ICxMy), it uses separate tracks with distinct progressions.

**When to use this framework:**
- Organizations preferring simpler, more familiar structures
- Companies where IC and Management paths are distinct choices
- Teams that want clarity without multi-dimensional complexity
- Organizations in industries with strong traditional level conventions

**When to use the Composable Framework instead:**
- Organizations that value technical leadership + management combinations
- Companies that want to avoid forced "IC vs Management" choices
- Teams with many hybrid roles (Tech Leads, Technical Directors)
- Organizations emphasizing flexible career paths

Both frameworks share the same outcome-based philosophy: **levels describe what success looks like, not just years of experience or task lists.**

---

## Framework Structure

### Two Primary Tracks

**Individual Contributor Track**: Levels 1-5
- Measures technical/domain expertise, scope, impact, and autonomy
- Pure technical/functional contribution without people management

**Management Track**: Levels 1-3
- Measures people leadership, organizational impact, and team scale
- Combines people management with some level of technical/domain work

**Note**: These are separate progressions. Moving from IC to Management typically means starting at a lower management level than your IC level (e.g., IC4 â†’ M1).

## Career Progression & Transitions

### IC Track Progression

**Standard Path**
```
IC1 (0-2 years) â†’ IC2 (2-4 years) â†’ IC3 (3-5 years) â†’ IC4 (4-8 years) â†’ IC5 (rare)
```

**Key Transition Points**

**IC2 â†’ IC3: "The Senior Threshold"**
- Biggest cultural shift: from doing to leading through doing
- Requires demonstration of consistent excellence over time
- Must show impact beyond personal output (mentorship, team improvement)
- Often the longest tenure at a single level (2-4 years at IC2)

**IC3 â†’ IC4: "The Organizational Impact Threshold"**
- Shift from team-level to organizational-level impact
- Must demonstrate strategic thinking and broad influence
- Many ICs plateau at IC3; IC4 requires different skillset
- Typically requires 3-5 years of excellence at IC3

**IC4 â†’ IC5: "The Distinguished Few"**
- Only a small percentage of ICs reach this level
- Requires sustained organizational and industry-level impact
- Must be recognized both internally and externally as exceptional
- Often takes 5-10+ years at IC4
- Many organizations have very few (or zero) IC5 positions
- **Plateauing at IC3 or IC4 represents strong career success**

### Management Track Progression

**Standard Path from IC**
```
IC3 â†’ M1 (first management) â†’ M2 (3-5 years) â†’ M3 (varies greatly)
```

**Key Transition Points**

**IC3 â†’ M1: "Becoming a Manager"**
- Most common entry point into management
- Requires letting go of IC identity and achievements
- First year is typically challenging and growth-focused
- Success depends more on people skills than technical expertise
- Reversible decision if not the right fit

**M1 â†’ M2: "Becoming Independently Effective"**
- Shift from learning to proficiency
- Must demonstrate ability to handle complexity without oversight
- Typically 3-5 years at M1 before promotion
- Some people plateau at M1; M2 requires different judgment and maturity
- May involve managing managers or leading larger/more complex teams

**M2 â†’ M3: "Senior Leadership"**
- Highly competitive; fewer positions available
- Requires sustained excellence at M2 and demonstrated strategic impact
- Shift from managing teams to shaping organizational capability
- Must develop other managers to excellence ("teaching management")
- Often requires organizational growth or change to create opportunity
- Many excellent managers have successful careers at M2 without reaching M3
- Typically 4-8+ years at M2, often longer

### Lateral Transitions

**Management â†’ IC (Returning to IC Track)**

**When This Happens**:
- Manager realizes management isn't the right fit
- Manager misses deep technical/domain work
- Organizational changes eliminate management role
- Manager seeks different type of impact

**Common Patterns**:
- M1 (1-2 years) â†’ IC3: Relatively straightforward return
- M1 (3+ years) or M2 â†’ IC3 or IC4: May need to rebuild technical depth
- M2 (long tenure) or M3 â†’ IC4+: Challenging; requires maintaining technical currency

**Success Factors**:
- Technical skills kept current during management tenure
- Clear understanding of the trade-offs being made
- Time spent rebuilding deep expertise if needed
- Not framed as "demotion" but as career direction change

**IC â†’ Management (First-Time Manager)**

**Typical Entry Points**:
- IC3 â†’ M1: Most common (75% of cases)
- IC4 â†’ M1: Occasional (20% of cases) - senior IC taking on team
- IC2 â†’ M1: Rare (5% of cases) - usually in specific contexts

**Success Factors**:
- Demonstrated leadership potential in IC role
- Strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence
- Desire to impact through people, not just through personal work
- Support system (mentor, manager coaching)
- Realistic expectations about the difficulty of the transition

## Promotion Guidelines

### Core Promotion Philosophy

**Promotions are earned, not given based on time.**
- Time at level is necessary but not sufficient
- Must demonstrate sustained performance at next level
- Promotions recognize impact already being delivered, not potential

**Promotion criteria are cumulative.**
- Must continue meeting all criteria from previous levels
- New level requirements build on foundation of previous levels
- Cannot have gaps in foundational skills while demonstrating advanced skills

### Evaluation Framework

**Three-Part Assessment**:

1. **Current Level Mastery**
   - Consistently operating at top end of current level
   - All current level outcomes reliably achieved
   - Recognized as exemplar at current level

2. **Next Level Performance**
   - Already demonstrating success outcomes of next level
   - Sustained performance (6-12 months minimum) at next level
   - Not just potential - actual evidence of operating at that level

3. **Readiness for Continued Growth**
   - Trajectory suggests continued growth beyond next level
   - Learning and adapting to increasing complexity
   - Not at ceiling of capability at next level

### Promotion Timing

**Typical Timeframes** (guidelines, not rules):

| Transition | Typical Time at Level | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| IC1 â†’ IC2 | 1-2 years | Learning fundamentals |
| IC2 â†’ IC3 | 2-4 years | Building deep competence |
| IC3 â†’ IC4 | 3-5 years | Demonstrating organizational impact |
| IC4 â†’ IC5 | 5-10+ years | Sustained exceptional impact; rare |
| M1 â†’ M2 | 3-5 years | Becoming proficient at management |
| M2 â†’ M3 | 4-8+ years | Senior leadership is highly competitive |

**Early Promotions** (faster than typical):
- Require exceptional performance and clear evidence
- More common at junior levels (IC1 â†’ IC2, IC2 â†’ IC3)
- Rare at senior levels where judgment and seasoning matter
- Must still demonstrate sustained performance, just faster

**Delayed Promotions** (slower than typical):
- Often indicates person has plateaued at current level
- May indicate organizational constraints (no positions available)
- Not inherently negative - many ICs happily stay at IC3 or IC4
- Important to distinguish "not ready" from "no opportunity"

### Red Flags in Promotion Discussions

**Warning Signs of Premature Promotion**:
- "They've been at this level for X years" (time alone doesn't qualify)
- "They're at risk of leaving if not promoted" (retention concerns â‰  promotion criteria)
- "They're doing some things at the next level" (some â‰  sustained performance)
- "They need the title to be effective" (if true, they're not ready)
- "Everyone else on the team is that level" (leveling is individual, not team-based)

**Valid Promotion Indicators**:
- "They've been operating fully at the next level for 9+ months"
- "Other teams see them as already at that level"
- "They're the go-to person for next-level work"
- "Performance reviews consistently cite next-level impact"
- "They're making others at the next level more effective"

---

## Special Cases & Considerations

### Leveling for Specialized Roles

Some roles don't fit cleanly into IC or Management tracks:

**Technical Lead / Tech Lead**
- **If managing people (3+ direct reports)**: Use Management track (typically M1-M2)
- **If pure technical leadership, no reports**: Use IC track (typically IC3-IC4)
- Clarify expectations and accountability - is this a people management role or not?

**Architects / Principal Engineers**
- Use IC track (typically IC4-IC5)
- Ensure scope and impact match level
- Avoid inflated titles without corresponding impact

**Managers with Very Small Teams** (1-2 reports)
- Consider if this is truly a management role or should be IC track
- If management: Likely M1, possibly M2 if very senior reports
- May indicate organizational design issue

### Leveling in Acquisitions or Hiring

**When Integrating Acquired Companies**:
- Don't automatically preserve titles/levels from acquired company
- Assess against your framework's criteria
- Grandfather existing levels with sunset date if needed
- Communicate framework clearly to acquired team

**When Hiring Externally**:
- Use framework criteria, not candidate's current title
- Previous title indicates likely level but isn't deterministic
- Assess actual outcomes and capabilities against framework
- Set level based on expected impact, not just to match current comp
- Be willing to hire "below level" if candidate shows strong trajectory

### Dealing with Level Compression

**The Problem**:
- Too many people at senior levels (many IC4s, M2-M3s)
- Not enough distinction between levels
- Junior levels feel progression is blocked

**Solutions**:
- Tighten promotion criteria at senior levels
- Grandfather existing levels but raise bar going forward
- Create clear expectations for each level
- Be comfortable with most people plateauing at IC3 or M2
- Ensure compensation can grow within level

### Plateauing is Normal

**Expected Distribution** in a healthy organization:
- **IC1-IC2**: 40-50% (entry and growing professionals)
- **IC3**: 35-40% (senior professionals - largest group)
- **IC4**: 10-15% (staff level - select few)
- **IC5**: <5% (distinguished - very rare)

**Management**:
- **M1**: Most managers (60-70%)
- **M2**: Smaller group (25-35%)
- **M3**: Small group (<10% of all managers)

**Key Messages**:
- Plateauing at IC3 or M2 represents strong career success
- Not everyone needs to reach the top level
- Career satisfaction comes from mastery and impact, not just titles
- Compensation should grow within levels for sustained excellence

## Using This Framework

### Implementation Checklist

**For New Companies** (Starting from Scratch):
- [ ] Define which levels you'll use initially (often IC1-IC3, M1-M2 is sufficient early on)
- [ ] Set compensation bands for each level
- [ ] Level existing team members against framework
- [ ] Document decision-making and create examples
- [ ] Train managers on the framework
- [ ] Create promotion process and cadence
- [ ] Plan to add higher levels as company grows

**For Existing Companies** (Adopting This Framework):
- [ ] Map existing titles/levels to this framework
- [ ] Identify inconsistencies and outliers
- [ ] Decide how to handle discrepancies (grandfather, adjust, reorg)
- [ ] Communicate changes clearly with rationale
- [ ] Set timeline for transition
- [ ] Update all job descriptions and postings
- [ ] Train managers on new framework
- [ ] Update performance review and promotion processes

### Annual Review & Calibration

**Leveling is not static.** Review regularly:

- **Quarterly**: Manager-level calibrations on performance and promotions
- **Annually**: Framework review and adjustments
- **As-needed**: When organizational structure changes significantly

**Calibration Meetings**:
- Review each team member's level and performance
- Discuss promotion candidates against framework
- Identify leveling inconsistencies
- Share examples of each level to build shared understanding
- Document decisions and rationale

### Communication Guidelines

**With Team Members**:
- Be transparent about framework and criteria
- Share level expectations proactively
- Provide regular feedback on progression
- Discuss multiple possible career paths
- Don't promise promotions, discuss trajectory
- Be honest about plateaus and what drives advancement

**With Hiring Managers**:
- Require leveling decision before posting job
- Assess candidates against framework, not other offers
- Document leveling rationale in hiring decision
- Set clear expectations for new hire's first 90 days

**With Leadership**:
- Report on level distribution regularly
- Flag concerning patterns (compression, imbalances)
- Recommend framework adjustments based on data
- Connect levels to business outcomes

## Appendix: Comparison with Composable Framework

### When to Choose Traditional Framework

âœ… **Choose Traditional if**:
- Simpler mental model preferred
- IC and Management seen as distinct career paths
- Less emphasis on hybrid roles (Tech Lead Managers)
- Want familiar structure for external benchmarking
- Smaller organization with straightforward needs
- Traditional industry norms favor this approach

### When to Choose Composable Framework

âœ… **Choose Composable if**:
- Value precision in describing capabilities
- Many hybrid roles (IC + Management)
- Want to avoid "IC vs Management" forced choice
- Emphasize flexible career paths
- Larger organization with complex role needs
- Want to track IC and Management skills independently

### Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional | Composable |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Structure** | Separate IC and Management tracks | Two dimensions (ICx, My) that compose |
| **Levels** | IC1-IC5, M1-M3 | IC1-IC5, M0-M3, combined as ICxMy |
| **Hybrid Roles** | Awkward to describe | Natural (e.g., IC4M2) |
| **Simplicity** | Simpler, more familiar | More complex, more precise |
| **Career Transitions** | IC â†” Management requires track change | Can adjust one dimension at a time |
| **External Communication** | Easier (familiar to candidates) | Requires explanation |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible, more prescriptive | Very flexible, supports many patterns |

### Can You Use Both?

**Yes.** Some organizations use Composable internally and Traditional externally:
- Track career progression using ICxMy internally
- Use traditional levels for job postings, offers, and external communication
- Map between them as needed (e.g., IC4M1 â†’ "L4 Staff Engineer / Tech Lead" or "M1 Engineering Manager")

This provides precision when it matters and simplicity when external audiences are involved.

## Summary

The Traditional Leveling Framework provides a complete, standalone career framework using conventional level structures with IC levels 1-5 and Management levels 1-3. It defines success criteria at each level using outcome-based language rather than task lists or years of experience.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Outcomes over tasks**: Each level describes what success looks like
2. **Cumulative expectations**: Higher levels build on lower levels
3. **Promotion = sustained performance**: Must demonstrate next-level work before promotion
4. **Multiple valid career paths**: Not everyone progresses to the top; plateauing is normal and healthy
5. **Framework clarity enables fairness**: Clear criteria reduce bias and inconsistency
6. **IC5 and M3 represent senior leadership**: These are the highest levels and relatively few people reach them

**Common Career Outcomes**:
- Many strong ICs have successful careers plateauing at IC3 or IC4
- Many excellent managers have successful careers plateauing at M1 or M2
- Only exceptional individuals reach IC5 or M3
- Career satisfaction comes from mastery and impact, not constantly climbing levels

**Use this framework** when you need a complete, traditional leveling system that provides clarity for performance management, career development, and organizational design while maintaining simplicity and familiarity.
