## How to Use This Assessment

This assessment evaluates readiness for Senior Engineer (IC3). For each competency:

- **Employee self-assesses** with specific examples of IC3-level work
- **Manager assesses** based on observed behavior and impact
- **Discuss gaps** and identify development actions

## Rating Scale
