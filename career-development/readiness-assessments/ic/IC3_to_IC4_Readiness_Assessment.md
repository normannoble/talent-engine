# IC3 to IC4 Readiness Assessment

## Senior Software Engineer to Staff Software Engineer

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Employee Name** | |
| **Manager** | |
| **Date** | |
| **Time at IC3** | |

## Assessment Context

IC4 (Staff) represents a fundamental shift from team-level to organizational-level impact. This assessment evaluates readiness for that transition.

- **Employee self-assesses** with specific examples of organizational impact
- **Manager assesses** based on observed impact across teams
- **Skip-level input** may be valuable given the cross-organizational nature of IC4 work

## Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1 - Not Yet** | Operating at IC3 level; organizational-level impact not yet demonstrated |
| **2 - Emerging** | Shows IC4 behaviors in some areas; needs broader and more sustained demonstration |
| **3 - Ready** | Consistently demonstrates IC4-level impact across the organization |

*IC4 readiness requires "3 - Ready" in most areas. This is a high bar — IC4 is selective.*
