## Assessment Context

IC5 (Distinguished) is the highest level of individual contribution, reserved for engineers with sustained company-level and industry impact. This assessment is typically conducted by a senior panel including executive leadership.

- **Candidate prepares evidence packet** documenting sustained IC5-level impact
- **Sponsor presents case** to assessment panel
- **Panel evaluates evidence** against IC5 criteria
- **External validation** may be sought (industry peers, customers, partners)

## Rating Scale

| **2 - Emerging** | Shows IC5 impact in some areas; needs broader demonstration or more time |
| **3 - Ready** | Sustained, exceptional IC5-level impact clearly demonstrated |

*IC5 requires "3 - Ready" in all areas with compelling evidence. This is an exceptionally high bar.*
