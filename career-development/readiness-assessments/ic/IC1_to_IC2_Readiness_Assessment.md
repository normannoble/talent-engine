# IC1 to IC2 Readiness Assessment

## Associate Software Engineer to Software Engineer

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Employee Name** | |
| **Manager** | |
| **Date** | |
| **Time at IC1** | |

## How to Use This Assessment

This assessment should be completed collaboratively by the employee and manager. For each competency area:

- **Employee self-assesses first** with specific examples
- **Manager provides their assessment** based on observed behavior
- **Discuss gaps** between self-assessment and manager assessment
- **Identify development actions** for areas not yet at IC2 level

## Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1 - Not Yet** | Still operating at IC1 level; requires significant development |
| **2 - Emerging** | Shows IC2 behaviors inconsistently; needs more practice and development |
| **3 - Ready** | Consistently demonstrates IC2-level performance in this area |

*Promotion readiness requires "3 - Ready" in most areas, with no areas at "1 - Not Yet."*

## 1. Independent Execution

**IC2 expectation:** Delivers well-scoped features from design through completion with minimal oversight.
