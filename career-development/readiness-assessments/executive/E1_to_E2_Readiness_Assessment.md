# E1 to E2 Readiness Assessment

## Director of Engineering to Senior Director of Engineering

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Candidate** | |
| **Sponsor** | |
| **Date** | |
| **Time at E1** | |
| **Current Scope** | |

## Assessment Context

E2 (Senior Director) represents the shift from domain leadership to general management across engineering—from executive participation to true CTO partnership. This assessment evaluates readiness for that transition.

- Candidate prepares evidence documenting organizational-level impact
- Sponsor (typically CTO) presents case to assessment panel
- Panel evaluates evidence against E2 criteria
- CEO and/or board input may be incorporated given the role's scope

## Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 - Not Yet | Operating at strong E1 level; organizational-level impact not yet demonstrated |
| 2 - Emerging | Shows E2 impact in some areas; needs broader demonstration or more time |
| 3 - Ready | Consistently demonstrates E2-level impact and capability |

*E2 readiness requires '3 - Ready' in most areas. This is a very high bar for senior executive leadership.*
