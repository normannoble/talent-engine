### For Employees

**Before the IDP Conversation:**
- Reflect honestly on your strengths and gaps
- Review your progression guide and readiness assessment
- Think about what energizes vs. drains you
- Consider feedback you've received
- Come with questions, not just answers

**During the IDP Conversation:**
- Be open about your aspirations (even uncertain ones)
- Ask for honest feedback on your self-assessment
- Discuss realistic timelines
- Ask what opportunities exist
- Clarify what support you need

**After the IDP Conversation:**
- Take action—development happens through doing
- Track your progress
- Seek feedback proactively
- Raise obstacles early
- Update the plan as things change

### For Managers

**Before the IDP Conversation:**
- Review the employee's self-assessment
- Prepare honest feedback on their strengths and gaps
- Think about opportunities you can provide
- Consider their potential and realistic timeline
- Review progression guides for their target level

**During the IDP Conversation:**
- Listen first, then share your perspective
- Be honest about gaps (kindly but clearly)
- Help identify specific development actions
- Discuss what support you can realistically provide
- Align on timeline and expectations

**After the IDP Conversation:**
- Follow through on commitments
- Create opportunities proactively
- Provide feedback on development progress
- Check in regularly (not just at formal reviews)
- Advocate for them when opportunities arise

### The 70-20-10 Model

Research suggests development comes from:

| Source | % | Examples |
|--------|---|----------|
| **On-the-job experiences** | 70% | Stretch assignments, challenging projects, new responsibilities |
| **Learning from others** | 20% | Mentors, coaches, peers, feedback, observation |
| **Formal learning** | 10% | Courses, books, certifications, conferences |

**Implication:** Most of the IDP should focus on experiences and relationships, not courses.

### SMART Development Goals

Effective development actions are:
- **S**pecific: Clear and unambiguous
- **M**easurable: You'll know when you've achieved it
- **A**chievable: Realistic given constraints
- **R**elevant: Connected to development priorities
- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline

**Weak:** "Get better at communication"
**SMART:** "Present technical strategy to leadership team by Q2, gathering feedback and improving based on input"
