# Progression Guide: IC1 to IC2

## Associate Software Engineer to Software Engineer

## Overview

The transition from IC1 (Associate) to IC2 (Professional) represents the
shift from **learning with guidance** to **delivering independently**.
This is typically the first major career milestone for software
engineers and usually occurs after 1-2 years at IC1.

This guide outlines the key shifts required, specific skills to develop,
and how to demonstrate readiness for promotion.

## The Core Shift

| IC1 (Associate) | IC2 (Professional) |
|---|---|
| Task-level work with close guidance | Feature-level work with moderate guidance |
| Requires daily direction and review | Works independently on defined problems |
| Success = consistent improvement | Success = consistent delivery |
| Asks thoughtful questions | Proposes solutions with questions |
| Follows established patterns | Understands why patterns exist |
| Communicates when stuck | Anticipates and raises risks early |

*The fundamental question changes from **"Am I learning and
improving?"** to **"Am I reliably delivering quality work?"***

## Key Skills to Develop

### 1. Independent Execution

At IC1, you complete tasks that are handed to you. At IC2, you take
ownership of features from design through completion.

**What this looks like:**

- Given a feature requirement, you break it down into tasks yourself
- You identify edge cases, dependencies, and potential issues before starting
- You make reasonable technical decisions within scope without asking for approval on every detail
- Your work requires minimal rework after code review

**How to develop this:**

- Before asking your manager to break down work, try breaking it down yourself first and ask for feedback on your approach
- When you encounter a decision point, think through 2-3 options and their trade-offs before asking for guidance
- Keep a log of code review feedback and patterns—aim to address common issues before submitting
- Practice estimating how long tasks will take, then compare to actuals and calibrate

### 2. Technical Competence

At IC1, you're building foundational knowledge. At IC2, you have a
solid grasp of core concepts and can apply them consistently.

**What this looks like:**

- You write code that follows team standards without being reminded
- You debug common issues independently using logs, debuggers, and documentation
- You understand how your code fits into the broader system
- You write tests as a natural part of development, not as an afterthought

**How to develop this:**

- Read code written by senior engineers on your team—study patterns, not just syntax
- When you fix a bug, understand the root cause, not just the symptom
- Trace requests through the system end-to-end to understand how components connect
- Build something small outside of work to deepen understanding of tools you use daily

### 3. Proactive Problem-Solving

At IC1, you communicate when you're stuck. At IC2, you anticipate
issues and propose solutions before being asked.

**What this looks like:**

- You identify potential blockers early and raise them with proposed mitigations
- When you find a bug or issue, you investigate before escalating
- You know when to keep digging vs. when to ask for help (and you've calibrated this well)
- You surface problems with context and suggested next steps, not just "this is broken"

**How to develop this:**

- Set a personal time-box for investigation (e.g., 30 minutes) before asking for help
- When you do ask for help, document what you've already tried
- Practice the format: "Here's the problem, here's what I've tried, here's what I think we should do"
- At the start of each task, spend 10 minutes thinking about what could go wrong

### 4. Reliable Communication

At IC1, you report status when asked. At IC2, you proactively keep
stakeholders informed and flag issues early.

**What this looks like:**

- Your manager rarely needs to ask for status updates—you provide them proactively
- When timelines are at risk, you communicate early with context
- You participate meaningfully in standups, planning, and retrospectives
- Your written communication (PRs, tickets, Slack) is clear and provides sufficient context

**How to develop this:**

- Send a brief end-of-day update to your manager: what you did, what's next, any blockers
- Write PR descriptions that explain the "why," not just the "what"
- If you're going to miss a deadline, communicate the moment you know—not the day it's due
- Practice summarizing technical work for non-technical audiences

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these common mistakes that can delay your progression:

### Waiting to be told what to do

IC2 requires initiative. If you finish a task, look for the next one. If
requirements are unclear, propose an interpretation rather than waiting
for clarification.

### Asking for help too quickly (or not quickly enough)

Both extremes hurt you. Asking immediately shows you're not trying to
solve problems. Spinning for hours wastes time and frustrates your team.
Calibrate: try for 20-30 minutes, then ask with context about what
you've tried.

### Treating code review feedback as criticism

Code review is how you learn. If you're defensive or make excuses, you
miss growth opportunities. Track feedback patterns and address them
proactively in future PRs.

### Focusing only on technical skills

IC2 isn't just about writing better code—it's about reliable
delivery, communication, and collaboration. An engineer who writes great
code but misses deadlines and doesn't communicate isn't ready for IC2.

### Not taking ownership

At IC1, you execute tasks. At IC2, you own outcomes. If your feature
ships with bugs, that's your responsibility—even if QA missed it.
Start thinking like an owner.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

Promotion to IC2 requires sustained demonstration of IC2-level work over
time (typically 3-6 months). Here's how to build your case:

### Build a Track Record

- Document features you've delivered end-to-end with minimal guidance
- Note instances where you identified and resolved issues proactively
- Track your estimation accuracy over time (showing improvement)
- Collect positive feedback from code reviews and stakeholders

### Have the Conversation

- Tell your manager you're working toward IC2 and ask for specific feedback on gaps
- Ask for opportunities to take on IC2-level work (slightly larger scope, less guidance)
- Request regular check-ins on your progress toward promotion criteria
- Be patient—promotions recognize sustained performance, not one-time achievements

## Self-Assessment Questions

Ask yourself these questions honestly:

1. Can I take a well-defined feature from requirements to production with minimal check-ins?
2. Do my estimates usually land within a reasonable range of actuals?
3. Does my code pass review with minor feedback, not major rewrites?
4. Do I raise blockers and risks before my manager asks about them?
5. Can I debug most issues in my area without needing senior help?
6. Do teammates see me as reliable—someone who delivers what they commit to?

If you can answer "yes" to most of these consistently over several
months, you're likely ready for IC2.

## Typical Timeline

Most engineers progress from IC1 to IC2 in **1-2 years**. This varies
based on prior experience, learning speed, and opportunity. Faster
progressions (under 1 year) are possible but require exceptional
performance and clear evidence of sustained IC2-level work. Slower
progressions are also normal and don't indicate failure—everyone
develops at their own pace.

**Remember:** Promotion is not a reward for time served. It's
recognition that you're already operating at the next level
consistently.
