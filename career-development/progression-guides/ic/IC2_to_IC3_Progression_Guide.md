# Progression Guide: IC2 to IC3

## Software Engineer to Senior Software Engineer

## Overview

The transition from IC2 (Professional) to IC3 (Senior) represents the
shift from **reliable execution** to **technical leadership and team
multiplication**. This is often considered the most significant career
transition for engineers—moving from "getting things done" to
"making others more effective."

This transition typically takes 2-4 years at IC2 and requires
demonstrating sustained senior-level impact, not just technical skill
improvement.

## The Core Shift

| IC2 (Professional) | IC3 (Senior) |
|---|---|
| Feature-level work with moderate guidance | Project-level work, self-directed |
| Works independently on defined problems | Defines the problems and approaches |
| Follows team standards | Sets and improves team standards |
| Asks for help when stuck | Unblocks others who are stuck |
| Receives mentorship | Provides mentorship |
| Success = consistent personal delivery | Success = team outcomes and multiplication |
| Understands the system | Shapes the system |

*The fundamental question changes from **"Am I delivering reliably?"**
to **"Am I making my team more effective?"***

## Key Skills to Develop

### 1. Technical Leadership & Influence

At IC2, you follow established patterns and practices. At IC3, you
define and improve them.

**What this looks like:**

- You identify technical debt and systemic issues, then drive initiatives to address them
- Your architectural decisions consider long-term maintainability and downstream impacts
- You introduce new practices or tools that the team adopts and benefits from
- Others seek your opinion on technical decisions because your judgment is trusted

**How to develop this:**

- Start documenting technical decisions and their rationale—create ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Identify one area of technical debt and propose a plan to address it
- Study how senior engineers on your team make architectural decisions—what do they consider?
- Practice articulating trade-offs: when someone asks "should we do X?", outline the pros, cons, and your recommendation

### 2. Handling Ambiguity & Complexity

At IC2, you execute on well-defined problems. At IC3, you turn ambiguous
requirements into clear plans and deliver complex projects end-to-end.

**What this looks like:**

- You take vague requirements and clarify them through the right questions and proposals
- You lead projects with multiple components and coordinate across dependencies
- You anticipate problems and address them before they derail delivery
- You make sound decisions when there's no clear "right answer"

**How to develop this:**

- Volunteer to lead a project with unclear requirements—practice scoping and clarifying
- Before starting any project, write down what could go wrong and how you'd mitigate each risk
- When you face a decision with trade-offs, document your reasoning—review later to see if you were right
- Study past projects that went well or poorly—what made the difference?

### 3. Mentorship & Team Multiplication

At IC2, your impact is your own output. At IC3, your impact includes
making others more effective.

**What this looks like:**

- IC1-IC2 engineers grow faster because of your mentorship and guidance
- Your code reviews teach, not just approve—engineers learn from your feedback
- You unblock teammates quickly when they're stuck on technical problems
- You create documentation and resources that reduce ramp-up time for new team members

**How to develop this:**

- Ask to be assigned as a mentor for a new hire or intern
- In code reviews, add explanations for why you're suggesting changes, not just what to change
- When someone asks for help, guide them to the answer rather than just giving it
- Document something you learned the hard way so others don't have to

### 4. Business Context & Cross-functional Collaboration

At IC2, you focus on technical execution. At IC3, you understand the
business context and collaborate effectively with Product, Design, and
other stakeholders.

**What this looks like:**

- You make technical trade-offs that balance engineering excellence with business needs
- You communicate technical concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders
- Product and Design see you as a partner who contributes to solutions, not just implements them
- You understand why the team is building what it's building, not just how

**How to develop this:**

- Attend product planning meetings and understand the prioritization rationale
- When making technical recommendations, include the business impact
- Build relationships with your PM and designer—understand their constraints and goals
- Practice explaining technical concepts without jargon

## Common Pitfalls

### Thinking "Senior" means "better at coding"

IC3 isn't just IC2 with more technical skill. The jump is about scope,
influence, and multiplication—not just writing better code. An
engineer who writes excellent code but doesn't mentor, doesn't lead
projects, and doesn't improve team practices isn't operating at IC3.

### Being the hero instead of the multiplier

It's tempting to solve every problem yourself because you can do it
faster. But IC3 impact comes from enabling others. If you're always the
bottleneck, you're not scaling your impact.

### Avoiding ambiguity

IC2s can avoid unclear work by asking someone else to scope it. IC3s
must embrace ambiguity. If you only take on well-defined projects,
you're not demonstrating IC3 capability.

### Not building relationships outside engineering

IC3 requires effective cross-functional collaboration. If you only talk
to other engineers, you're missing half the job.

### Waiting for permission to lead

IC3 leadership isn't assigned—it's demonstrated. If you're waiting
for your manager to give you a leadership role, you're not showing
initiative. Find opportunities to lead and take them.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

Promotion to IC3 requires sustained demonstration of senior-level impact
over 6+ months. Here's how to build your case:

### Build a Track Record

- Document projects you've led end-to-end with significant complexity or ambiguity
- Track technical improvements you've driven that the team adopted
- Gather evidence of your mentorship impact—how have others grown because of you?
- Note instances where you were sought out for technical guidance or decisions

## Self-Assessment Questions

1. Can I take an ambiguous problem and deliver a complete solution with minimal guidance?
2. Do others come to me for technical advice? Do they trust my judgment?
3. Have I improved team practices, tools, or processes in a meaningful way?
4. Are junior engineers growing faster because of my mentorship?
5. Do I understand the business context for my work and make appropriate trade-offs?
6. Do Product and Design see me as a collaborative partner?

If you can answer "yes" to most of these consistently over 6+ months,
you're likely ready for IC3.

## Typical Timeline

Most engineers progress from IC2 to IC3 in **2-4 years**. This is often
the longest single-level tenure because IC3 requires developing
genuinely new capabilities—not just getting better at what you already
do. Many strong engineers have successful, fulfilling careers at IC2 or
IC3 without progressing further.

**Remember:** IC3 is about scope and multiplication, not just skill. You
need to demonstrate sustained impact at the senior level, not just
potential.
