# Progression Guide: IC3 to IC4

## Senior Software Engineer to Staff Software Engineer

## Overview

The transition from IC3 (Senior) to IC4 (Staff) represents a fundamental
shift from **team-level leadership** to **organizational-level impact**.
This is not a natural progression—it requires developing an entirely
different set of capabilities around strategic thinking, cross-team
influence, and creating leverage at scale.

Many excellent Senior Engineers have fulfilling careers without reaching
Staff level. IC4 is not "better" than IC3—it's a different kind of
role with different expectations. Only pursue this transition if the
work genuinely interests you.

## The Core Shift

| IC3 (Senior) | IC4 (Staff) |
|---|---|
| Project-level scope | Multi-project / system-level scope |
| Team-level impact | Organizational impact |
| Executes on technical strategy | Defines technical strategy |
| Solves the problems given | Identifies which problems to solve |
| Mentors IC1-IC2 engineers | Mentors IC3 engineers toward Staff |
| Influences within team | Influences across teams without authority |
| Go-to person on the team | Go-to person across the organization |

*The fundamental question changes from **"Am I making my team more
effective?"** to **"Am I shaping how the organization solves
problems?"***

## Key Skills to Develop

### 1. Strategic Technical Leadership

At IC3, you execute well on technical direction. At IC4, you define
technical strategy and drive initiatives that others haven't
recognized.

**What this looks like:**

- You identify high-impact technical initiatives that weren't on anyone's roadmap
- Your technical strategy documents guide decision-making across multiple teams
- You see connections and patterns across systems that others miss
- Your architectural decisions prove sound over years, not just months

**How to develop this:**

- Spend time understanding systems outside your immediate area—build a mental model of the whole
- Write technical strategy documents for your area and get feedback from senior leaders
- Ask "what's the biggest technical problem the organization isn't addressing?" and propose solutions
- Study how successful technical strategies were developed and communicated

### 2. Influence Without Authority

At IC3, you lead through expertise within your team. At IC4, you drive
change across teams and functions without formal authority over them.

**What this looks like:**

- You build coalitions to drive initiatives that span multiple teams
- Other teams adopt your recommendations because they trust your judgment
- You navigate organizational complexity and politics productively
- You can communicate effectively with executives and get buy-in for technical investments

**How to develop this:**

- Take on a project that requires coordination across multiple teams
- Practice framing technical proposals in terms of business value, not just technical merit
- Build relationships with engineers and leaders outside your immediate team
- Learn to navigate disagreement—how do you get alignment when people disagree?

### 3. Creating Leverage at Scale

At IC3, you multiply your team's effectiveness. At IC4, you create
leverage that multiplies effectiveness across the organization.

**What this looks like:**

- You build platforms, tools, or frameworks that many teams use and benefit from
- Standards and practices you establish are adopted broadly
- Your work creates capacity for others rather than just delivering your own output
- You unblock entire teams or initiatives, not just individual engineers

**How to develop this:**

- Look for patterns—what problems are multiple teams solving independently?
- Build something that serves multiple teams, not just your own
- Document and share approaches that could become organizational standards
- Ask "how can I solve this once for everyone?" instead of just solving it for your team

### 4. Executive Communication & Stakeholder Management

At IC3, you communicate technical concepts to your immediate
stakeholders. At IC4, you communicate strategy and trade-offs to senior
leadership.

**What this looks like:**

- You can present technical strategy to executives in terms they find compelling
- You build strong relationships with engineering leadership and other executives
- You successfully advocate for technical investments against competing priorities
- Your written communication is clear, concise, and compelling at the leadership level

**How to develop this:**

- Practice writing one-pagers that summarize complex technical topics for executive audiences
- Ask to present at leadership meetings—observe what resonates and what doesn't
- Learn the business context deeply—what does leadership care about and why?
- Get feedback on your communication from leaders who are effective at this

## Common Pitfalls

### Being the best Senior Engineer instead of operating at Staff level

Staff isn't "Senior but more so." You can be the best IC3 on the team
and still not be ready for IC4. The jump requires genuinely different
work—organizational scope, strategic influence, creating leverage at
scale.

### Staying in your comfort zone

IC4 requires working across teams, navigating organizational complexity,
and influencing without authority. If you only operate within your team,
you're not building IC4 capabilities.

### Waiting to be given Staff-level work

IC4s identify what needs to be done and drive it. If you're waiting for
someone to assign you cross-organizational initiatives, you're not
demonstrating IC4 capability.

### Focusing on technical depth at the expense of breadth

IC4 requires understanding systems beyond your immediate area. Pure
depth without breadth limits your ability to see connections and create
organizational leverage.

### Underestimating the importance of communication and influence

At IC4, your ability to communicate strategy, build coalitions, and
influence decisions is as important as your technical skills. Many
technically excellent IC3s plateau because they don't develop these
capabilities.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

Promotion to IC4 requires sustained demonstration of
organizational-level impact over 6-12+ months.

### Build a Track Record

- Document initiatives you drove that had impact beyond your team
- Track standards, platforms, or tools you created that others adopted
- Gather evidence of your influence across teams and functions
- Note instances where you identified important problems that weren't on anyone's radar

## Self-Assessment Questions

1. Have I driven initiatives with organizational impact, not just team impact?
2. Do people outside my team seek my input on technical decisions?
3. Have I successfully influenced direction across teams without formal authority?
4. Have I created platforms, standards, or practices that are adopted broadly?
5. Can I communicate technical strategy effectively to executive audiences?
6. Am I mentoring IC3s and helping them grow toward Staff level?

If you can answer "yes" to most of these consistently over 6-12+
months, you may be ready for IC4.

## Typical Timeline

Most engineers who progress from IC3 to IC4 do so in **3-5 years**,
though this varies significantly. Many excellent IC3s choose not to
pursue Staff level, and that's a completely valid career choice. IC4
positions are also more limited—organizations typically have fewer
Staff+ roles than Senior roles.

**Important:** Plateauing at IC3 represents strong career success.
Don't pursue IC4 unless the work genuinely interests you and aligns
with your strengths.
