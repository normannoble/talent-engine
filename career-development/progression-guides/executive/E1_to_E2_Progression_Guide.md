# Progression Guide: E1 to E2

## Director of Engineering to Senior Director of Engineering

## Overview

The transition from E1 (Director) to E2 (Senior Director) represents the shift from domain leadership to general management across engineering. While Directors own specific technology domains with full accountability, Senior Directors take a cross-cutting perspective—ensuring the whole of engineering works together effectively.

At E1, you own a domain and operate as an executive participant. At E2, you're a strategic partner to the CTO, often deputizing in their absence. You develop Directors into future senior executives, shape how engineering leadership operates, and represent technology externally.

This transition is primarily qualitative, not quantitative. It's not about managing more—it's about a fundamentally different type of work: from domain excellence to organizational leadership, from executive participation to executive partnership.

This transition typically takes 3-5+ years at E1, and E2 positions are rare. Many excellent Directors have fulfilling careers at E1—that's a significant executive achievement.

## The Core Shift

| E1 (Director) | E2 (Senior Director) |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Owns a specific domain | General management across domains |
| Executive participant | Executive partner (to CTO) |
| Develops M3s toward Director | Develops E1s toward Senior Director/CTO |
| Domain strategy (1-3 years) | Company technology strategy (2-5 years) |
| Internal executive presence | Internal + external executive presence |
| Accountable for domain outcomes | Accountable for engineering-wide outcomes |
| Represents domain in executive forums | Can represent CTO/technology organization |
| Board exposure when applicable | Regular board presence expected |

*The fundamental question changes from 'Am I accountable for domain success?' to 'Am I shaping how engineering as a whole succeeds?'*

## Key Capabilities to Develop

### 1. Cross-Domain Leadership

At E1, you optimize your domain. At E2, you optimize across domains—ensuring the whole of engineering works together effectively for company outcomes.

**What this looks like:**

- Multiple domains or cross-cutting functions under your influence work together seamlessly
- You resolve cross-domain conflicts with lasting solutions, not temporary compromises
- Resource allocation decisions optimize for company outcomes, not any single domain
- Strategic coherence exists across domains—investments tell a consistent story
- You think and act at the organizational level, not the domain level

**How to develop this:**

- Seek opportunities to lead cross-domain initiatives or resolve cross-domain tensions
- Build deep relationships with peer Directors—understand their domains and challenges
- Practice making recommendations that optimize for the whole, even at domain expense
- Study organizational design—how do effective engineering organizations structure themselves?
- Look for patterns across domains—what improvements would benefit everyone?

### 2. Executive Partnership with CTO

At E1, you participate in executive discussions. At E2, you're a true partner to the CTO—contributing to technology strategy, not just executing on it.

**What this looks like:**

- The CTO relies on you as a thought partner on major decisions
- You can represent the CTO credibly in executive forums, board settings, or externally
- You contribute to shaping technology strategy, not just implementing it
- Other executives see you as a peer who understands the whole technology organization
- In the CTO's absence, you're the natural leader of technology

**How to develop this:**

- Build a close working relationship with the CTO—understand their priorities and concerns
- Volunteer to represent the CTO in forums where they can't attend
- Contribute ideas and perspectives on technology strategy proactively
- Develop relationships with board members or investors when opportunities arise
- Practice thinking at the CTO level—what would you do if you had their scope?

### 3. Developing Executive Leaders

At E1, you develop M3s toward Director. At E2, you develop Directors (E1s) into future Senior Directors and CTO candidates.

**What this looks like:**

- Directors you develop are growing toward Senior Director or CTO capability
- You delegate significant organizational decisions to develop their judgment
- You create opportunities for Directors to operate at E2 level before they have the title
- Succession planning means engineering leadership isn't dependent on any individual
- Other companies recruit Directors you've developed for senior executive roles

**How to develop this:**

- Shift focus from developing management capability to developing executive judgment
- Give Directors ownership of cross-domain problems—stretch their scope
- Create opportunities for Directors to interact with board, investors, and external audiences
- Discuss their path to Senior Director or CTO explicitly
- Coach on organizational leadership, not just domain leadership

### 4. External Presence

At E1, your presence is primarily internal. At E2, you represent the company's technology capabilities externally—building reputation, attracting talent, and creating strategic value.

**What this looks like:**

- You're recognized externally as a technology leader, not just internally
- Your external presence attracts talent and creates partnership opportunities
- You can represent the company credibly to customers, partners, and industry
- Thought leadership builds the company's reputation in the market
- Industry relationships create strategic value—insights, partnerships, opportunities

**How to develop this:**

- Build external presence through speaking, writing, or community involvement
- Represent the company at customer or partner meetings with technology focus
- Develop relationships with technology leaders at peer companies
- Contribute to industry discourse in your areas of expertise
- Make your external presence a deliberate part of your development plan

## Common Pitfalls

### Optimizing for your domain instead of the organization

The biggest shift from E1 to E2 is from domain focus to organizational focus. If you're still primarily advocating for your domain, you're not operating at E2.

### Being a super-Director instead of an organizational leader

E2 isn't 'Director with more domains.' It's a qualitatively different role focused on how engineering as a whole succeeds. Manage through your Directors, don't out-Director them.

### Neglecting external presence

E2s represent the company externally. If you're entirely internally focused, you're missing a key dimension of the role.

### Not building a true CTO partnership

E2 requires being a genuine thought partner to the CTO, not just an excellent executor. If you're not contributing to technology strategy at the company level, you're not operating at E2.

### Developing M3s instead of E1s

Your development focus shifts at E2. If you're still primarily developing M3s, you're not operating at the right level. Your Directors should be developing M3s.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

Promotion to E2 requires sustained demonstration of organizational-level impact over 18-24+ months.

### Build a Track Record

- Document cross-domain impact and organizational-level contributions
- Track Directors you've developed and their trajectory toward senior executive roles
- Gather feedback from CTO about your partnership and readiness for broader scope
- Build external presence that creates value for the company

### Self-Assessment Questions

- Am I optimizing for organizational outcomes, not domain outcomes?
- Am I a true thought partner to the CTO on technology strategy?
- Am I developing Directors toward Senior Director or CTO capability?
- Do I represent the company's technology capabilities credibly externally?
- Can I deputize for the CTO effectively in their absence?
- Do cross-domain problems get resolved through my leadership?

If you can answer 'yes' to most of these consistently over 18-24+ months, you may be ready for E2.

## Typical Timeline

Most leaders who progress from E1 to E2 do so in 3-5+ years at E1. This reflects:

- Building organizational-level impact beyond domain success
- Developing a true CTO partnership
- Growing Directors who demonstrate your executive development capability
- Building meaningful external presence
- E2 positions being very limited—often only 1-2 in an organization this size

**Important: E1 represents significant executive success. Many excellent Directors have fulfilling careers at E1 without reaching E2. Pursue E2 only if organizational leadership across engineering—CTO partnership, cross-domain accountability, external presence—genuinely aligns with your interests and strengths.**
