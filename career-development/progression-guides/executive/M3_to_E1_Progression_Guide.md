# Progression Guide: M3 to E1

## Head of Engineering to Director of Engineering

## Overview

The transition from M3 (Head of Engineering) to E1 (Director of Engineering) represents the shift from senior management to executive leadership. While M3 is already a significant leadership role—managing managers, shaping engineering at scale, and contributing to company strategy—E1 marks the transition to full executive accountability.

At M3, you lead a significant portion of engineering and contribute to strategy. At E1, you own a technology domain with full accountability for business outcomes, operate as a member of the executive team, and develop M3s into future Directors.

This transition typically takes 3-5+ years at M3, and E1 positions are limited. Many excellent M3s have fulfilling careers at that level—and that's a significant achievement.

## The Core Shift

| M3 (Head of Engineering) | E1 (Director) |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Manages managers within engineering | Owns a technology domain with full accountability |
| Contributes to company strategy | Shapes company strategy as executive participant |
| Develops M1s and M2s | Develops M3s toward Director-level capability |
| Engineering culture at scale | Cross-functional executive partnerships |
| Represents engineering in executive forums | Member of executive/leadership team |
| Strategic thinking (6-18 months) | Strategic vision (1-3 years) |
| Technical credibility with Staff+ ICs | Strategic technical judgment at domain level |
| Internal stakeholder management | Board exposure (when applicable) |

*The fundamental question changes from 'Am I building organizational capability within engineering?' to 'Am I accountable for domain outcomes that drive business success?'*

## Key Capabilities to Develop

### 1. Domain Ownership & Business Accountability

At M3, you're accountable for engineering outcomes within your scope. At E1, you own a domain with full accountability for how it contributes to business success.

**What this looks like:**

- You own outcomes end-to-end—not just engineering execution, but business impact
- You make investment decisions that balance technical excellence with business value
- You're accountable for domain strategy, not just executing on organizational strategy
- Problems in your domain don't escalate—you resolve them or own the consequences
- You can articulate how your domain creates competitive advantage, not just capability

**How to develop this:**

- Shift from 'delivering what's asked' to 'owning what matters'—propose strategy, don't just execute
- Build deep understanding of how your area impacts revenue, costs, and competitive position
- Practice making and defending investment trade-offs with business rationale
- Take accountability for outcomes even when external factors contribute—own it fully
- Develop relationships with business leaders to understand their priorities and constraints

### 2. Executive Participation

At M3, you contribute to executive discussions when invited. At E1, you're a participant in shaping company strategy as a member of the leadership team.

**What this looks like:**

- You contribute to company strategy beyond technology—your perspective shapes business decisions
- You operate as a peer to other functional leaders, not a technical expert being consulted
- Cross-functional partnerships are strategic, not just operational coordination
- You can represent your domain credibly to board, investors, or external stakeholders
- Your communication style and presence are calibrated for executive audiences

**How to develop this:**

- Seek opportunities to participate in cross-functional strategic initiatives
- Build relationships with executives outside engineering—understand their world
- Practice presenting to senior audiences—get feedback on your executive presence
- Learn the language of business—revenue, margin, competitive dynamics, market position
- Volunteer for board prep or investor communications support to build exposure

### 3. Developing M3-Level Leaders

At M3, you develop M1s and M2s. At E1, you develop M3s (Heads of Engineering) into future Directors.

**What this looks like:**

- M3s in your domain are growing toward executive capability, not just executing well
- You delegate domain-level decisions to build their strategic judgment
- You create stretch opportunities that prepare them for Director-level work
- Succession planning means the domain isn't dependent on you
- M3s you develop are recognized as future executive candidates

**How to develop this:**

- Shift from coaching on management execution to coaching on strategic leadership
- Delegate consequential decisions—let M3s own outcomes with real stakes
- Create opportunities for M3s to present to executives and build relationships
- Explicitly discuss their path to Director with development plans
- Give feedback on their strategic thinking, not just their management practice

### 4. Strategic Technical Leadership

At M3, you maintain technical credibility and provide direction within your scope. At E1, you set technical strategy for your domain that creates competitive advantage.

**What this looks like:**

- Technical strategy for your domain is clearly articulated and guides decisions
- You evaluate technology investments based on business value, not just technical merit
- Architectural decisions in your domain prove sound over years
- You balance innovation with reliability based on business context
- Senior ICs (IC4-IC5) respect you as a leader with sound strategic technical judgment

**How to develop this:**

- Write domain technical strategy documents and get executive feedback
- Practice connecting technical decisions to business outcomes explicitly
- Build relationships with IC4-IC5 engineers—learn from their deep expertise
- Study technology trends and their implications for your domain and company
- Make and track technology bets—build a record of sound judgment

## Common Pitfalls

### Staying in management mode rather than executive mode

E1 isn't 'bigger M3.' The shift is qualitative—from building organizational capability to owning domain outcomes. If you're still focused primarily on engineering execution, you're not operating at E1.

### Not developing true executive presence

Executive communication, stakeholder management, and cross-functional partnership require different skills than managing engineering. Invest in developing your executive presence deliberately.

### Focusing on your domain at the expense of company perspective

E1s optimize for company outcomes, not domain outcomes. If you're advocating for your domain without considering company-level trade-offs, you're not thinking like an executive.

### Neglecting external relationships and presence

E1s increasingly represent the company externally. If you're entirely internally focused, you're missing a dimension of the role.

### Not delegating enough to M3s

Your growth requires M3s to take on more. If you're not delegating domain-level decisions to them, you're limiting both their development and your capacity to operate at E1.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

Promotion to E1 requires sustained demonstration of executive-level impact over 12-24+ months.

### Build a Track Record

- Document domain outcomes you've owned with clear business impact
- Track strategic contributions beyond engineering—company-level influence
- Gather feedback from executives about your readiness for expanded scope
- Note M3s you've developed and their trajectory

### Self-Assessment Questions

- Am I accountable for domain outcomes with clear business impact?
- Do I participate in company strategy, not just execute on it?
- Am I developing M3s toward Director-level capability?
- Do executives see me as a peer, not just a functional leader?
- Can I represent my domain credibly to board, investors, or external audiences?
- Does my technical strategy create competitive advantage?

If you can answer 'yes' to most of these consistently over 12-24+ months, you may be ready for E1.

## Typical Timeline

Most leaders who progress from M3 to E1 do so in 3-5+ years at M3. This reflects:

- Building a track record of domain-level business outcomes
- Developing executive presence and cross-functional relationships
- Growing M3s who demonstrate your development capability
- E1 positions being limited—opportunity matters as much as readiness

**Important: M3 represents significant leadership success. Many excellent leaders have fulfilling careers at M3 without reaching E1. Pursue E1 only if executive leadership—domain ownership, board exposure, external presence—genuinely aligns with your interests and strengths.**
