# Progression Guide: E2 to E3

## Senior Director of Engineering to Chief Technology Officer

## Overview

The transition from E2 (Senior Director) to E3 (Chief Technology Officer) represents the move to the most senior technology leadership role in the company. While Senior Directors partner closely with the CTO, the CTO role carries ultimate accountability for the company's technology strategy, organization, and capabilities.

At E2, you're a CTO partner and can deputize in their absence. At E3, you are the technology executive—a peer to the CEO and other C-level leaders, accountable to the board, and responsible for technology as a source of competitive advantage.

This transition is rare and highly dependent on opportunity. Most E2s will not become CTOs at their current company—there's typically only one CTO. However, understanding what E3 requires helps E2s maximize their impact and prepares them for CTO opportunities elsewhere.

## The Core Shift

| E2 (Senior Director) | E3 (CTO) |
|----------------------|----------|
| Executive partner to CTO | The technology executive |
| Represents CTO when needed | Represents company technology |
| Develops E1s toward Senior Director | Develops E1s and E2s toward CTO |
| Company technology strategy (2-5 years) | Technology vision (5+ years) |
| External presence in industry | Industry thought leader |
| Supports board communication | Owns board communication for technology |
| Contributes to executive decisions | Shapes executive decisions as C-level peer |
| Accountable for engineering excellence | Accountable for technology as competitive advantage |

*The fundamental question changes from 'Am I shaping how engineering succeeds?' to 'Am I accountable for technology as a source of company success?'*

## Key Capabilities to Develop

### 1. Ultimate Technology Accountability

At E2, you share accountability with the CTO. At E3, you own technology outcomes fully—strategy, organization, execution, and reputation. The buck stops with you.

**What this looks like:**

- Technology strategy creates sustainable competitive advantage over 5+ year horizons
- Technology investments prove sound and build cumulative value for the company
- The engineering organization is a source of competitive advantage—attracts talent, delivers reliably, innovates
- Technology risks are identified, quantified, and managed without surprises
- You own outcomes fully—no one else to share accountability with

**How to develop this:**

- Take on 'CTO-level' problems when opportunities arise—act as if you're accountable
- Build your track record of sound technology bets over multi-year horizons
- Develop comprehensive understanding of technology risk across all dimensions
- Practice owning outcomes without caveats—build the judgment that comes with accountability
- Study CTOs you admire—what makes their judgment sound and their organizations successful?

### 2. C-Level Executive Leadership

At E2, you're a senior executive who partners with the CTO. At E3, you're a C-level peer to the CEO, CFO, and other executives—shaping company strategy, not just technology strategy.

**What this looks like:**

- You operate as a true peer to the CEO and other C-level executives
- Technology perspective is integrated into all major company decisions through your voice
- Board communication builds confidence in technology strategy, investment, and risk
- Investor relations include compelling technology narrative as part of company story
- Cross-functional executives see you as a strategic partner, not a functional leader

**How to develop this:**

- Build relationships with CEO and board members—understand their perspectives and concerns
- Participate in board prep and investor communications when opportunities arise
- Develop your ability to translate technology into business and financial terms
- Study how effective CTOs operate at the board and investor level
- Practice C-level communication—strategic, concise, business-focused

### 3. Developing Future CTOs

At E2, you develop Directors toward Senior Director. At E3, you develop the entire executive bench—E1s and E2s—toward CTO-level capability. Your legacy includes the leaders you develop.

**What this looks like:**

- E1s and E2s are growing toward CTO capability through deliberate development
- Succession planning means the company could sustain your departure
- The engineering leadership culture you've built operates with excellence
- Leaders you've developed go on to CTO roles (at your company or elsewhere)
- Your approach to technology leadership becomes part of how the company operates

**How to develop this:**

- Be deliberate about developing E2s toward CTO-level thinking
- Create opportunities for senior leaders to operate at the next level
- Build a leadership culture that will outlast your tenure
- Document your approach to technology leadership for others to learn from
- Think about your legacy—what will remain after you've moved on?

### 4. Industry Thought Leadership

At E2, you have external presence. At E3, you're a recognized thought leader whose perspective shapes how the industry thinks about technology.

**What this looks like:**

- You're recognized as a thought leader in your domain across the industry
- Your perspective influences how others approach technology problems
- External presence attracts exceptional talent and creates partnership opportunities
- Customers and partners value your technology perspective
- You contribute to industry discourse through speaking, writing, and community leadership

**How to develop this:**

- Build a distinctive point of view that others find valuable
- Increase external engagement—speaking, writing, community involvement
- Develop relationships with peer CTOs and technology leaders
- Represent the company at major industry events and customer meetings
- Contribute to shaping industry standards or practices where relevant

### 5. Strategic Initiatives & Governance

At E3, you own dimensions of technology leadership that may not have been visible at E2—M&A due diligence, technology partnerships, governance, and crisis management.

**What this looks like:**

- M&A due diligence is thorough—technology aspects of acquisitions evaluated and integrated successfully
- Build vs. buy decisions balance speed, cost, capability, and strategic fit
- Technology partnerships create strategic value
- Governance enables speed while maintaining appropriate controls
- Crisis management is effective—the organization responds well when things go wrong

**How to develop this:**

- Seek involvement in M&A activities when opportunities arise
- Develop judgment about technology partnerships and vendor relationships
- Understand governance requirements—security, compliance, risk management
- Build crisis management capability—how would you lead through a major incident?
- Study how CTOs handle the strategic dimensions of the role

## Common Pitfalls

### Thinking like a Senior Director with more scope

CTO isn't 'E2 plus.' It's a qualitatively different role with ultimate accountability, C-level dynamics, and board-level responsibility. The shift is fundamental, not incremental.

### Not building board-level capability

CTO requires effective board communication. If you haven't developed this skill, you're not ready for the role. Board dynamics are different from executive team dynamics.

### Underestimating the breadth of the role

CTO encompasses M&A, investor relations, governance, crisis management, and industry leadership—not just engineering excellence. Develop capability across all dimensions.

### Not developing a succession pipeline

Great CTOs build leaders who can succeed them. If you're not developing E2s toward CTO capability, you're not thinking about the role correctly.

### Waiting for the opportunity instead of preparing

CTO opportunities are rare. Prepare now by operating at CTO level in every dimension you can. When the opportunity comes, you should already be ready.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

CTO transitions happen through opportunity—internal promotion or external hire. Readiness requires sustained demonstration of CTO-level capability.

### Build a Track Record

- Document technology outcomes you've driven with clear competitive advantage
- Track your board and investor communication experience
- Gather evidence of your industry thought leadership and external presence
- Note leaders you've developed toward executive and C-level capability

### Self-Assessment Questions

- Am I accountable for technology as a source of competitive advantage?
- Can I operate as a true peer to CEO and other C-level executives?
- Am I effective at board-level communication and investor relations?
- Am I developing E1s and E2s toward CTO-level capability?
- Am I recognized as an industry thought leader?
- Can I lead through M&A, governance, and crisis situations?

If you can answer 'yes' to most of these with strong evidence, you may be ready for a CTO role.

## Typical Timeline and Opportunity

The E2 to E3 transition is unlike other progressions because it's primarily about opportunity, not just capability:

- Most companies have only one CTO—internal promotion requires the current CTO to depart
- Many E2s become CTOs by moving to other companies
- Time at E2 before CTO opportunity varies enormously (2-10+ years)
- Some E2s have successful, fulfilling careers without becoming CTO

### Preparing for opportunity:

- Operate at CTO level in every way you can within your current role
- Build external relationships and reputation that create CTO opportunities
- Stay in close dialogue with your CEO and board about your aspirations
- Be open to CTO opportunities at other companies if that's your goal

**Important: E2 represents exceptional executive success. Many outstanding technology leaders have fulfilling careers as Senior Directors. Pursue CTO only if ultimate technology accountability—board responsibility, industry leadership, building lasting competitive advantage—genuinely aligns with your interests and strengths.**
