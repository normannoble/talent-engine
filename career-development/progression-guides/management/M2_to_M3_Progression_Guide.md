# Progression Guide: M2 to M3

Senior Engineering Manager → Head of Engineering

## Overview

The transition from M2 (Senior Engineering Manager) to M3 (Head of Engineering) represents the shift from managing teams to developing other managers and shaping how engineering operates at scale. This is a fundamental change in the nature of your work.

At M2, your success is measured by your team's performance. At M3, your success is measured by your managers' growth and your organization's capability. You operate primarily through others, and your impact comes from the leaders you develop and the systems you create.

This transition typically takes 4-8+ years at M2, and M3 positions are limited. Many excellent M2 managers have fulfilling careers without reaching M3—and that's completely valid.

## The Core Shift

| M2 (Senior Engineering Manager) | M3 (Head of Engineering) |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Manages engineers (and possibly a few M1s) | Manages managers (M1s and M2s) |
| Team-level impact | Organizational-level impact |
| Executes on strategy | Shapes strategy and direction |
| Builds high-performing teams | Develops high-performing managers |
| Handles complex situations independently | Teaches others to handle complex situations |
| Creates team processes | Creates organizational systems and culture |
| Stakeholder management | Executive partnership |
| Technical contributor when critical | Strategic technical judgment |

*The fundamental question changes from 'Am I building an excellent team?' to 'Am I developing excellent managers and shaping how engineering works?'*

## Key Capabilities to Develop

### 1. Developing Other Managers

At M2, you manage engineers and perhaps mentor new managers. At M3, developing managers is your primary work. Your success is measured by their growth and effectiveness.

**What this looks like:**

- Managers you develop become excellent leaders—they don't just execute, they grow
- You delegate meaningfully—giving managers real ownership, not just tasks
- You coach managers through difficult situations rather than solving for them
- Your direct reports are ready for larger roles when opportunities arise
- Former direct reports credit you with accelerating their development

**How to develop this:**

- Shift from 'solving' to 'coaching'—ask questions instead of giving answers
- Create stretch opportunities for your managers—let them struggle productively
- Give feedback on their management approach, not just their outcomes
- Study manager development—it's a distinct skill from managing ICs
- Build a reputation for developing talent—people should want to work for you

### 2. Organizational Design and Scale

At M2, you optimize your team's structure and processes. At M3, you design organizations—how teams fit together, how decisions get made, how work flows across the engineering function.

**What this looks like:**

- You structure teams and responsibilities for effectiveness at scale
- Coordination overhead doesn't grow proportionally with team size
- Decision rights are clear—people know who decides what
- Information flows effectively—the right people know the right things
- Your organizational changes stick—they solve problems durably

**How to develop this:**

- Study organizational design—read about how successful companies structure engineering
- Analyze what's working and not working in your current organization
- When problems arise, ask 'is this a people problem or a structure problem?'
- Understand the trade-offs of different org structures (functional, product, matrix)
- Practice thinking about roles and responsibilities abstractly, not just in terms of people

### 3. Strategic Leadership

At M2, you execute on organizational strategy. At M3, you shape that strategy. You represent engineering in executive discussions and contribute to company direction.

**What this looks like:**

- You contribute meaningfully to company strategy, not just receive it
- Engineering strategy is clearly connected to business objectives
- You plan 6-18 months ahead, anticipating needs before they're urgent
- Executive leadership seeks your perspective on major decisions
- Your strategic recommendations are adopted and prove sound

**How to develop this:**

- Understand the business deeply—revenue, costs, competitive dynamics, market trends
- Practice connecting engineering decisions to business outcomes
- Build relationships with executives—understand their priorities and constraints
- Think longer-term—what does engineering need to look like in 2-3 years?
- Develop your executive presence—how you communicate at that level matters

### 4. Culture and Talent at Scale

At M2, you build culture within your team. At M3, you shape engineering culture across the organization and create conditions that attract and retain excellent talent.

**What this looks like:**

- Engineering is known for excellence—you attract strong candidates
- Culture is consistent across teams—values are lived, not just stated
- You identify and address organizational health issues proactively
- Standards and practices are adopted broadly, not just on your direct teams
- Regrettable attrition is low across the organization

**How to develop this:**

- Be intentional about culture—define what you want and work toward it systematically
- Measure organizational health (engagement, retention, satisfaction) and act on what you learn
- Invest in employer brand—how is engineering perceived externally?
- Create forums for engineering community—all-hands, guilds, tech talks
- Model the culture you want—your behavior sets the tone

### 5. Technical Credibility at Scale

At M2, you contribute technically when critical. At M3, you maintain strategic technical judgment and the ability to engage deeply when situations demand senior perspective.

**What this looks like:**

- You influence major architectural decisions and technology choices
- Senior ICs respect you as someone who understands the work
- You can evaluate technical risks and trade-offs at the organizational level
- You engage hands-on when situations require senior technical perspective
- Technical strategy under your leadership proves sound over time

**How to develop this:**

- Stay connected to technical work—code reviews, architecture discussions, incidents
- Understand technology trends and how they might impact your organization
- Build strong relationships with your Staff+ engineers—learn from them
- Make time for technical depth despite management demands
- Don't delegate all technical decision-making—stay engaged on what matters

## Common Pitfalls

**Continuing to manage teams instead of developing managers**

The M3 role is fundamentally about developing other managers. If you're still spending most of your time on team-level concerns, you're not doing the M3 job. Let your managers manage.

**Micromanaging your managers**

M3 requires delegation and trust. If you're reviewing every decision your managers make, you're not giving them room to grow—and you're not scaling your impact.

**Losing touch with the work**

M3s must maintain technical credibility. If you've completely disconnected from technical reality, you'll make poor decisions and lose the respect of senior ICs. Stay engaged.

**Optimizing for short-term execution over long-term capability**

M3s should be building organizational capability, not just hitting quarterly goals. If you're always in firefighting mode, you're neglecting the strategic part of the role.

**Underestimating the executive partnership aspect**

M3 requires working effectively with executives. If you're uncomfortable in executive discussions or can't translate technical strategy into business terms, you'll struggle.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

Promotion to M3 requires demonstrated organizational impact and manager development over an extended period.

### Build a Track Record

- Document managers you've developed and how they've grown
- Track organizational improvements you've driven
- Gather feedback from executives about your strategic contribution
- Note instances where you've shaped direction at the organizational level

### Self-Assessment Questions

1. Am I developing managers who are becoming excellent leaders themselves?
2. Do I design organizations effectively—structure, roles, decision rights?
3. Am I contributing to company strategy, not just executing on it?
4. Have I shaped engineering culture at scale?
5. Do I maintain technical credibility while operating at the organizational level?
6. Am I effective in executive discussions and partnerships?

If you can answer 'yes' to most of these consistently over 1-2+ years, you may be ready for M3.

## Typical Timeline

Most managers who progress from M2 to M3 do so in 4-8+ years at M2. This reflects several factors:

- Developing managers takes time—you need to see them grow over years
- Strategic capability is built through experience with varied challenges
- M3 positions are limited—opportunity matters as much as readiness
- The skills required are genuinely different and take time to build

**Important: M3 represents senior leadership, and many excellent managers have successful, fulfilling careers at M2. Pursue M3 only if the work genuinely interests you—managing managers, shaping organizations, operating at the executive level. It's a different job, not a 'better' one.**
