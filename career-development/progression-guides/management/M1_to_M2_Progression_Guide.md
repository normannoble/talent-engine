# Progression Guide: M1 to M2

Engineering Manager → Senior Engineering Manager

## Overview

The transition from M1 (Engineering Manager) to M2 (Senior Engineering Manager) represents the shift from learning management fundamentals to operating independently with confidence. This is the management equivalent of moving from 'developing your craft' to 'mastering your craft.'

At M1, you're building foundational management skills with guidance from senior leaders. At M2, you handle complex people situations independently, make sound decisions without validation, and create systems that help your team scale. Your manager trusts you to operate autonomously.

This transition typically takes 3-5 years at M1 and requires demonstrating sustained independent effectiveness, not just time in role.

## The Core Shift

| M1 (Engineering Manager) | M2 (Senior Engineering Manager) |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Small team (3-6 people) | Larger team (8-15) or multiple teams |
| Learning management fundamentals | Operating independently with confidence |
| Handles straightforward situations | Handles complex situations without oversight |
| Seeks guidance on difficult decisions | Makes sound decisions confidently |
| Escalates complex people issues | Resolves complex people issues independently |
| Follows management practices | Creates scalable systems and practices |
| Technical contributor when needed | Technical contributor when critical |
| Building trust with team | Building high-performing team culture |

*The fundamental question changes from 'Am I learning to be an effective manager?' to 'Am I operating effectively without oversight?'*

## Key Capabilities to Develop

### 1. Independent People Management

At M1, you handle straightforward situations and escalate complex ones. At M2, you handle the full range of people situations—performance issues, conflicts, retention risks, terminations—with confidence and sound judgment.

**What this looks like:**

- You navigate difficult performance conversations without needing coaching on approach
- You make compensation, promotion, and termination decisions confidently
- You resolve interpersonal conflicts before they escalate or require senior intervention
- You retain key talent through proactive engagement, not reactive scrambling
- Your people decisions prove sound over time—few surprises or reversals

**How to develop this:**

- Ask your manager to let you lead on increasingly complex situations with coaching, not rescue
- Document your decision-making process for difficult calls—review outcomes 6 months later
- Build a peer network of other managers to discuss challenging situations
- Read and study difficult management situations—build mental models before you face them
- Practice delivering hard messages—get feedback on your approach

### 2. Building High-Performing Teams

At M1, you're focused on team delivery and basic health. At M2, you deliberately build culture, drive engagement, and create conditions for sustained excellence.

**What this looks like:**

- Your team has a distinct, positive culture that people can articulate
- Engagement is consistently high—people want to stay and grow on your team
- Team members are developing meaningfully, with visible career progression
- Other teams want to work with yours; you have a reputation for excellence
- Attrition is low and intentional—people leave for the right reasons

**How to develop this:**

- Be intentional about culture—what do you want your team to be known for?
- Create development plans for each team member and actually execute them
- Measure engagement and act on what you learn—don't just survey and ignore
- Study what makes your best performers successful; replicate those conditions
- Build hiring practices that select for culture contribution, not just skills

### 3. Systems and Scale

At M1, you execute management practices. At M2, you create processes and systems that help your team operate efficiently and scale with growth.

**What this looks like:**

- You have documented processes for recurring activities (onboarding, reviews, planning)
- Knowledge is shared—the team isn't dependent on any single person
- New team members ramp up quickly because systems support them
- Your practices improve over time based on retrospectives and feedback
- You can scale the team without proportionally scaling your personal time

**How to develop this:**

- Document what's in your head—make implicit knowledge explicit
- After each process, ask 'how could this be better next time?' and actually improve it
- Delegate ownership of processes to team members—don't be the bottleneck
- Look for patterns in problems—if something keeps happening, fix the system
- Invest in onboarding—it pays dividends in faster ramp and better retention

### 4. Strategic Alignment and Stakeholder Management

At M1, you translate organizational goals to your team. At M2, you actively shape priorities, manage complex stakeholder relationships, and ensure your team's work is aligned with what matters most.

**What this looks like:**

- Your team's roadmap clearly connects to company strategy—no one is confused about 'why'
- Stakeholders trust you—they know you'll deliver and communicate proactively
- You navigate competing priorities and make trade-offs that stick
- Cross-functional partners see you as collaborative and effective
- You represent your team's interests effectively without being adversarial

**How to develop this:**

- Understand the business deeply—what matters to your stakeholders and why?
- Communicate proactively—don't wait to be asked about status or risks
- When conflicts arise, seek win-win solutions before escalating
- Build relationships with key stakeholders outside of transactional interactions
- Practice saying 'no' constructively—with alternatives and rationale

## Common Pitfalls

**Waiting to be told you're ready**

M2 readiness is demonstrated, not granted. If you're waiting for your manager to tell you you're operating at M2 level, you're probably not. Take on M2-level challenges proactively.

**Still escalating too much**

The biggest signal of M2 readiness is handling complex situations independently. If you're still bringing every difficult conversation or decision to your manager, you're not demonstrating M2 capability.

**Focusing on scale before effectiveness**

Managing more people doesn't make you M2. Managing people well—handling complexity, building culture, creating systems—does. Don't seek scale before you've mastered effectiveness.

**Neglecting your own development**

At M1, others are investing in developing you. At M2, you're more self-directed. If you're not actively working on your growth, you'll plateau. Seek feedback, find mentors, keep learning.

**Losing technical credibility**

M2 managers stay technically relevant. If you've completely disconnected from technical work, you'll lose credibility with your team and make worse decisions. Find ways to stay engaged.

## How to Demonstrate Readiness

Promotion to M2 requires sustained demonstration of independent, effective management over 6-12+ months.

### Build a Track Record

- Document complex people situations you've handled successfully without significant guidance
- Track team health metrics—engagement, retention, development outcomes
- Gather feedback from stakeholders about your effectiveness and reliability
- Note systems and processes you've created that improved team operations

### Self-Assessment Questions

1. Do I handle complex people situations (PIPs, conflicts, retention) without significant manager oversight?
2. Do I make sound people decisions confidently—hiring, comp, promotions, terminations?
3. Does my team have a strong culture with high engagement and low regrettable attrition?
4. Have I created systems and practices that help the team scale?
5. Do stakeholders trust me to deliver and communicate proactively?
6. Am I maintaining technical credibility while focusing on management?

If you can answer 'yes' to most of these consistently over 6-12+ months, you're likely ready for M2.

## Typical Timeline

Most managers progress from M1 to M2 in 3-5 years. This timeframe allows for:

- Experiencing the full cycle of management activities (hiring, reviews, difficult conversations)
- Building judgment through handling varied situations
- Demonstrating sustained effectiveness, not just occasional success
- Creating track record that proves independent capability

**Important: Plateauing at M1 is normal and can be fulfilling. Not everyone needs to reach M2—many managers have successful, satisfying careers leading single teams. Pursue M2 only if the work genuinely interests you and aligns with your strengths.**
