# Engineering Management Career Progression

*Management Track Overview*

## Introduction

This document outlines career progression on the Management track for engineering leaders. Whether you're considering your first management role or are an experienced manager looking to grow, this guide will help you understand what success looks like at each level, how promotions work, and what it takes to develop as a people leader.

Our approach to leveling is outcome-based, not task-based. Each level describes what success looks like—the desired end states—rather than a checklist of activities. This means you're evaluated on impact and outcomes, not just what you do day-to-day.

## Core Philosophy

**Management levels measure people leadership capability and effectiveness, not organizational scale.** Like IC levels, they follow a progression of learning → doing → teaching. Scale (team size, organizational complexity) is a context factor that influences the difficulty of operating at each level, but does not define the level itself.

As you progress through management levels, the fundamental question changes:

- M1: "Am I learning to be an effective manager?"
- M2: "Am I operating effectively without oversight?"
- M3: "Am I developing excellent managers and shaping how management works?"

**Plateauing is normal and healthy.** Many managers have successful, fulfilling careers at M1 or M2. Not everyone needs to reach the top level, and the happiest managers are those who find fulfillment in their work, regardless of title.

## The Three Management Levels at a Glance

| Level | Title | Primary Focus | Core Question |
|-------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| M1 | Engineering Manager | Learning management fundamentals | Am I learning to be an effective manager? |
| M2 | Senior Engineering Manager | Operating independently with confidence | Am I effective without oversight? |
| M3 | Head of Engineering | Developing managers and shaping culture | Am I developing excellent managers? |

## M1: Engineering Manager

*Learning Management Fundamentals*

The Engineering Manager is a first-level people leader responsible for building and leading a small engineering team (typically 3-8 engineers). This role marks the transition from individual contribution to people leadership, with a focus on developing foundational management skills while maintaining technical credibility.

### What Success Looks Like

- A team that consistently delivers quality work and meets commitments, with clear ownership and accountability
- Team members who understand expectations, receive regular feedback, and are developing their skills
- A healthy team culture with psychological safety, where people feel comfortable raising concerns
- Basic management practices executed consistently: regular 1:1s, timely feedback, clear goal-setting
- Growing ability to handle people situations with confidence, demonstrating improvement over time
- Technical credibility maintained through contribution, code review participation, and guidance

### Key Characteristics

- First-time manager or early in management journey
- Learning how to conduct effective 1:1s, give feedback, and manage performance
- Building trust and rapport with direct reports
- Needs regular coaching and guidance from their own manager
- Making mistakes and learning from them in a supported environment
- Handles straightforward people situations; escalates complex issues

### Typical Experience

3-6 years of professional software engineering experience. First formal management role, or less than 2 years in a management capacity. Usually promoted from IC2-IC3 (occasionally IC4).

## M2: Senior Engineering Manager

*Operating Independently with Confidence*

The Senior Engineering Manager is a proficient people leader who manages with independence and confidence. This role may involve leading a larger team (8-15 engineers), multiple smaller teams, or a team of particularly senior engineers. The emphasis is on operating effectively without significant oversight from senior leadership.

### What Success Looks Like

- Teams that consistently deliver high-quality work with strong culture and high engagement
- Low regrettable attrition; people leave for the right reasons (growth opportunities elsewhere)
- Team members showing meaningful career growth with clear development plans
- Complex people situations handled independently: performance issues, conflicts, retention risks
- Sound people decisions made confidently: hiring, compensation, promotions, and terminations
- Strong stakeholder relationships built on trust, transparency, and reliable delivery
- Processes and practices that help the team operate efficiently and scale with growth

### Key Shift from M1

The fundamental question changes from "Am I learning to be an effective manager?" to "Am I operating effectively without oversight?" At M1, you handle straightforward situations and escalate complex ones. At M2, you handle the full range of people situations with confidence and sound judgment. Your manager trusts you to operate autonomously.

### Typical Experience

6-10+ years of professional experience. 3-5+ years in engineering management with demonstrated growth in capability. Progression from M1 typically takes 3-5 years.

## M3: Head of Engineering

*Developing Managers and Shaping Culture*

The Head of Engineering is a senior leader responsible for a significant portion of the engineering organization, managing other engineering managers (M1s and M2s) and shaping how engineering operates at scale. This role reports to executive leadership and contributes directly to company strategy and direction.

### What Success Looks Like

- Multiple teams delivering consistently against strategic objectives with coordinated execution
- Engineering managers who are growing in capability and becoming excellent people leaders
- Delegation that develops managers while ensuring quality outcomes
- A management culture with shared practices, standards, and expectations across teams
- Bench strength and succession planning; the organization isn't dependent on any single manager
- Engineering standards and practices adopted across teams that improve quality and productivity
- High engagement and retention across the organization, with culture that attracts strong talent
- Strategic technical judgment that influences major decisions; credibility with Staff+ ICs

### Key Shift from M2

The fundamental question changes from "Am I operating effectively without oversight?" to "Am I developing excellent managers and shaping how management works?" At M2, your success is measured by your team's performance. At M3, your success is measured by your managers' growth and your organization's capability. You operate primarily through others.

### Typical Experience

10-15+ years of professional experience. 5-8+ years in engineering management, including experience managing other managers. Progression from M2 typically takes 4-8+ years, and M3 positions are limited.

## How Promotions Work

### Core Principles

**Promotions are earned, not given based on time.** Time at level is necessary but not sufficient. You must demonstrate sustained performance at the next level—promotions recognize impact already being delivered, not potential.

**Promotion criteria are cumulative.** You must continue meeting all criteria from previous levels. Higher levels build on the foundation of previous levels.

### What We Look For

- **Current Level Mastery:** Consistently operating at the top end of your current level
- **Next Level Performance:** Already demonstrating success outcomes of the next level for 6-12+ months
- **Readiness for Continued Growth:** Trajectory suggests continued growth beyond the next level

### Typical Timelines

| Transition | Typical Time | Note |
|------------|--------------|------|
| M1 → M2 | 3-5 years | Becoming proficient at management |
| M2 → M3 | 4-8+ years | Senior leadership is highly competitive |

*Note: These are guidelines, not guarantees. Faster progressions are possible with exceptional performance; slower progressions are also normal.*

## Common Career Patterns

### Healthy Distribution

In a healthy organization, the level distribution for managers looks something like this:

- **M1:** 60-70% of managers (most managers)
- **M2:** 25-35% of managers (experienced managers)
- **M3:** <10% of all managers (senior leadership)

### Key Messages

- **Plateauing at M1 or M2 represents strong career success.** Not everyone needs to reach M3.
- **Career satisfaction comes from mastery and impact, not just titles.**
- **Compensation can grow within levels.** Sustained excellence at your current level is recognized.
- **Different levels require different skills.** Moving up isn't just about getting better—it's about developing genuinely new capabilities.

## Transitions Between Tracks

Management and IC careers are not one-way doors:

- **M1 (1-2 years) → IC3:** Relatively straightforward return to IC track
- **M1 (3+ years) or M2 → IC3/IC4:** May need to rebuild technical depth
- **IC3 → M1:** Most common entry point into management (75% of cases)
- **IC4 → M1:** Occasional (20% of cases)—senior IC taking on team

Moving between tracks is valid and respected. The key is finding work that aligns with your interests and strengths.

## Your Career Development

### Taking Ownership

Your career development is primarily your responsibility. While your manager will support you, you should take initiative to:

- Understand what success looks like at your current level and the next
- Seek feedback proactively and act on it
- Look for opportunities to demonstrate next-level capabilities
- Have honest conversations with your manager about your career goals
- Document your impact and contributions

### Questions to Reflect On

- Am I consistently demonstrating success at my current level?
- What capabilities do I need to develop to reach the next level?
- What opportunities can I seek to develop those capabilities?
- Is the work at the next level genuinely interesting to me?
- What does long-term career fulfillment look like for me?
