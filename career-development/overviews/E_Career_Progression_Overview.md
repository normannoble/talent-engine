# Engineering Executive Career Progression

*Executive Track Overview*

## Introduction

This document outlines career progression on the Executive track for senior technology leaders. The Executive track (E1-E3) represents the transition from senior management to executive leadership, with increasing accountability for company-level technology strategy and business outcomes.

Our approach to leveling is outcome-based, not task-based. Each level describes what success looks like—the desired end states—rather than a checklist of activities. This means you're evaluated on impact and outcomes, not just what you do day-to-day.

Executive roles are rare and highly selective. Many excellent M3-level leaders have fulfilling careers without reaching the Executive track, and that represents significant success. These roles require a genuine interest in executive leadership: board accountability, external presence, company-level strategy, and developing the next generation of senior leaders.

## Core Philosophy

**Executive levels represent the transition from management to executive leadership.** The shift is qualitative, not just quantitative—it's about the nature of the work, not just the scale.

As you progress through executive levels, the fundamental question changes:

- E1 (Director): "Am I accountable for domain outcomes that drive business success?"
- E2 (Senior Director): "Am I shaping how engineering as a whole succeeds?"
- E3 (CTO): "Am I accountable for technology as a source of company success?"

**Plateauing is normal and healthy.** M3 represents significant leadership success. E1 represents executive achievement. Not everyone needs to reach E3—the CTO role requires specific interests and capabilities that may not align with everyone's strengths.

## The Three Executive Levels at a Glance

| Level | Title | Scope | Core Question |
|-------|-------|-------|---------------|
| E1 | Director | Domain ownership | Am I accountable for domain business outcomes? |
| E2 | Senior Director | Cross-domain / CTO partner | Am I shaping how engineering succeeds? |
| E3 | CTO | Company technology leadership | Am I accountable for technology as competitive advantage? |

## E1: Director of Engineering

*Domain Ownership and Executive Leadership*

The Director of Engineering is an executive leader who owns a significant technology domain (such as Platform, Product Engineering, Infrastructure, or Data). This role operates at the intersection of technology strategy and business outcomes, with full accountability for the domain's success.

Directors move beyond managing managers to developing future Heads of Engineering (M3s), shaping executive-level strategy, and building cross-functional partnerships with other executives. They are accountable not just for engineering excellence, but for how their domain contributes to company success.

### What Success Looks Like

- A technology domain that delivers measurable business value with clear connection between engineering investments and company outcomes
- Strategic vision for the domain that anticipates needs 1-3 years ahead
- Technical excellence that creates competitive advantage, not just operational capability
- Full accountability for domain outcomes—quality, delivery, reliability, business impact—owned without escalation
- Contributions to company strategy as an executive participant, not just a functional leader
- Cross-functional executive partnerships with Product, Design, Finance that improve company-wide outcomes
- M3s (Heads of Engineering) who are growing toward Director-level capability
- High engagement and retention across the domain; organization known as a destination for talent

### Key Shift from M3

The fundamental question changes from "Am I building organizational capability within engineering?" to "Am I accountable for domain outcomes that drive business success?" At M3, you contribute to strategy. At E1, you own domain strategy with full business accountability. You're a member of the executive team, not just a senior manager.

### Typical Experience

12-18+ years of professional experience in technology. 6-10+ years in engineering management, including experience at M3 level or equivalent. Progression from M3 typically takes 3-5+ years.

## E2: Senior Director of Engineering

*Cross-Domain Leadership and CTO Partnership*

The Senior Director of Engineering is a senior executive who operates across multiple technology domains or owns critical cross-cutting concerns that span the entire engineering organization. Where Directors own specific domains, Senior Directors take a general management perspective—ensuring the whole of engineering works together effectively.

This role serves as a close partner to the CTO, often deputizing in their absence and contributing directly to technology strategy at the company level. Senior Directors develop Directors (E1s) into future executive leaders, shape how engineering leadership operates, and represent the company's technology capabilities externally.

### What Success Looks Like

- Multiple technology domains or cross-cutting functions that work together effectively with clear alignment
- Organizational effectiveness across engineering—coordination, prioritization, resource allocation optimized for company outcomes
- Strategic coherence across domains—technology investments tell a consistent story
- A true partnership with the CTO—contributes to technology strategy, not just executes on it
- Ability to represent the CTO and technology organization credibly in executive forums, board contexts, or externally
- Directors (E1s) who are growing toward Senior Director or CTO-level capability
- An engineering organization that operates effectively at scale—growth increases capability, not just complexity
- External presence through thought leadership that builds company reputation and attracts talent

### Key Shift from E1

The fundamental question changes from "Am I accountable for domain success?" to "Am I shaping how engineering as a whole succeeds?" The shift is from domain excellence to organizational leadership, from executive participation to executive partnership. You optimize for engineering-wide outcomes, not domain outcomes.

### Typical Experience

15-20+ years of professional experience in technology. 8-12+ years in engineering management, including meaningful time at Director (E1) level. Progression from E1 typically takes 3-5+ years, and E2 positions are very rare.

## E3: Chief Technology Officer

*Ultimate Technology Accountability*

The Chief Technology Officer is the senior-most technology executive, with ultimate accountability for the company's technology strategy, engineering organization, and technical capabilities. The CTO serves on the executive team as a peer to the CEO, CFO, and other C-level leaders, and represents technology to the board of directors, investors, customers, and the broader industry.

This role requires balancing multiple dimensions: setting technical vision while enabling execution, building organizational capability while delivering near-term results, and maintaining strategic perspective while staying grounded in technical reality. The CTO is both architect of the company's technology future and steward of its current capabilities.

### What Success Looks Like

- Technology vision and strategy that creates sustainable competitive advantage over 5+ year horizons
- Technology investments that prove sound and build cumulative value for the company
- A seat at the table as a true peer on the executive team—technology perspective integrated into all major company decisions
- Board-level communication that builds confidence in technology strategy, investment, and risk management
- An engineering organization that is a source of competitive advantage—attracts talent, delivers reliably, innovates
- Technology leadership team (E1s, E2s, M3s) that operates with excellence and continues developing
- Succession planning at all senior levels—organization's success doesn't depend on any single leader
- Recognition as an industry thought leader; external presence that enhances company reputation
- Effective risk management—security, reliability, compliance, technical debt understood and managed

### Key Shift from E2

The fundamental question changes from "Am I shaping how engineering succeeds?" to "Am I accountable for technology as a source of company success?" At E2, you partner with the CTO. At E3, you are the technology executive—a peer to the CEO, accountable to the board, responsible for technology as competitive advantage.

### Typical Experience

18-25+ years of professional experience in technology. 10-15+ years in engineering leadership, including significant time at Director or Senior Director level. CTO transitions are primarily about opportunity—most E2s will not become CTOs at their current company.

## How Executive Progressions Work

### Core Principles

**Executive transitions are about opportunity as much as capability.** Unlike IC or M-track progressions, executive positions are very limited. There may be only 2-4 E1 positions, 1-2 E2 positions, and exactly one CTO.

**The shift is qualitative, not quantitative.** Moving from M3 to E1 isn't about managing more. It's about a fundamentally different type of work—domain ownership, board accountability, executive partnership.

**External moves are common.** Many executives reach their level by moving to a new company. Internal promotion requires the right opportunity to exist.

### What We Look For

- **Demonstrated Impact:** Sustained track record of outcomes at the next level (12-24+ months)
- **Leadership Development:** History of developing leaders who themselves become senior executives
- **Strategic Judgment:** Technology decisions and investments that prove sound over years
- **Executive Presence:** Ability to operate effectively with board, investors, and external stakeholders
- **Cultural Fit:** Alignment with company values and ability to shape organizational culture

### Typical Timelines

| Transition | Typical Time | Note |
|------------|--------------|------|
| M3 → E1 | 3-5+ years | Transition to executive leadership |
| E1 → E2 | 3-5+ years | Very limited positions; often via external move |
| E2 → E3 | Varies greatly | Primarily opportunity-dependent |

*Note: These are rough guidelines. Executive transitions depend heavily on opportunity, organizational growth, and individual circumstances.*

## Key Differences from the Management Track

### Accountability

- **Management track (M1-M3):** Accountable for engineering outcomes—team performance, delivery, quality, talent development.
- **Executive track (E1-E3):** Accountable for business outcomes—how technology contributes to company success, competitive advantage, and strategic positioning.

### Stakeholders

- **Management track:** Primarily internal stakeholders—engineering teams, product partners, immediate leadership.
- **Executive track:** Internal and external stakeholders—board of directors, investors, customers, partners, industry community.

### Strategic Horizon

- **Management track:** Planning horizons of 6-18 months with focus on execution and team capability.
- **Executive track:** Planning horizons of 1-5+ years with focus on positioning, competitive advantage, and organizational capability.

### Development Focus

- **Management track:** Developing individual contributors and managers.
- **Executive track:** Developing executives and senior leaders who will shape the organization's future.

## Career Considerations

### Is the Executive Track Right for You?

The executive track may be right if you:

- Genuinely enjoy business strategy and connecting technology to company outcomes
- Are energized by external visibility—board presentations, customer meetings, industry presence
- Find deep satisfaction in developing other senior leaders and executives
- Are comfortable with ultimate accountability—the buck stops with you
- Think naturally about 3-5+ year horizons and building lasting competitive advantage
- Navigate organizational politics and executive dynamics effectively

The executive track may not be right if you:

- Prefer deep technical or organizational work over strategic and external responsibilities
- Find board and investor interactions draining rather than energizing
- Are more comfortable with shared accountability than ultimate ownership
- Prefer to focus on current execution rather than long-term positioning
- Would be pursuing executive roles for the title rather than genuine interest in the work

### Alternative Paths

**There's no shame in being an excellent M3.** Head of Engineering is a significant leadership achievement. Many outstanding technology leaders have fulfilling careers at M3 without pursuing the executive track.

Similarly, some leaders find deep satisfaction as E1 Directors without pursuing E2 or E3. Each level offers meaningful work and impact.
