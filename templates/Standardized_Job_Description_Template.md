## Notes on This Template

**Outcome-Based Philosophy:** Each outcome describes a desired end state, not a task list. Instead of "Develop a security strategy," we state "Security strategies and policies that are clearly communicated, adopted, and effectively protect company assets."

**Core Leadership Outcomes:** These three sections (Team Performance, Strategic Alignment, Operational Excellence) are consistent across all leadership roles, ensuring common expectations while allowing domain-specific customization.

**Domain-Specific Outcomes:** Number of sections will vary (2-4 typically) based on role complexity and scope. These should reflect the unique value this role creates.

**Success Definition:** If all stated outcomes are true, the person is successful in the role. This removes ambiguity and creates clear accountability without tying success to specific metrics that may change.
