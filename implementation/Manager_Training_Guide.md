# Manager Training Guide: Leveling Framework

## Introduction

This guide prepares managers to effectively use the leveling framework with their teams. After completing this training, you should be able to:

- Explain the framework's purpose and philosophy
- Accurately assess your team members' levels
- Have productive leveling and development conversations
- Participate effectively in calibration sessions
- Use the framework for ongoing performance management

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (can be split across sessions)

---

## Module 1: Framework Foundations

### 1.1 Why We Have a Leveling Framework

**The Problems We're Solving:**

| Problem | How the Framework Helps |
|---------|------------------------|
| "I don't know what's expected of me" | Clear job descriptions at each level |
| "Leveling seems arbitrary" | Consistent standards across teams |
| "I don't know how to grow" | Progression guides and readiness assessments |
| "Different managers have different bars" | Calibration ensures consistency |
| "I don't understand why I wasn't promoted" | Transparent criteria and evidence-based decisions |

**What the Framework Is:**
- A tool for clarity and fairness
- Outcome-based expectations for each level
- A shared language for development
- A foundation for consistent decisions

**What the Framework Is NOT:**
- A ranking system for employees
- A guarantee of promotion for tenure
- A rigid box that ignores context
- A replacement for manager judgment

### 1.2 Framework Philosophy

**Core Principle: Outcomes Over Activities**

We evaluate what people **accomplish**, not just what they **do**.

| Activity-Based (Avoid) | Outcome-Based (Use) |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| "Writes code" | "Delivers working features that meet requirements" |
| "Attends meetings" | "Influences technical decisions through effective communication" |
| "Mentors junior engineers" | "Junior engineers they mentor become independent contributors" |
| "Works hard" | "Consistently delivers quality work on time" |

**Core Principle: Sustained Performance**

Levels reflect what someone **consistently demonstrates**, not:
- One-time achievements
- Potential or trajectory
- Performance in a previous role
- What they might do if given the chance

**Core Principle: Plateauing Is Healthy**

Not everyone advances to senior levels, and that's fine:
- IC3 (Senior Engineer) is a successful career destination
- Depth and mastery are valuable
- We need excellent performers at every level
- Advancement is one path; sustained excellence is another

### 1.3 Framework Structure

**Three Tracks:**

```
Individual Contributor    Management           Executive
─────────────────────    ──────────────────   ──────────────────
IC5 Distinguished        M3 Head of Eng       E3 CTO
IC4 Staff                M2 Senior EM         E2 Senior Director
IC3 Senior               M1 Eng Manager       E1 Director
IC2 Engineer
IC1 Associate
```

**Each Level Has:**
- **Job Description:** Success outcomes, required skills, required experience
- **Progression Guide:** How to grow from previous level
- **Readiness Assessment:** Checklist for promotion consideration

---

### Exercise 1.1: Framework Philosophy Check

For each statement, identify whether it aligns with framework philosophy:

1. "Jordan has been here 5 years, so they should be IC4 by now."
   - [ ] Aligns
   - [x] **Doesn't align** — Tenure doesn't determine level

2. "Sam consistently delivers complex features independently with high quality."
   - [x] **Aligns** — Focuses on sustained, demonstrable outcomes
   - [ ] Doesn't align

3. "Alex has the potential to be a great Staff Engineer."
   - [ ] Aligns
   - [x] **Doesn't align** — Potential isn't performance; level reflects current state

4. "Riley excels at IC3 and has chosen to stay at this level."
   - [x] **Aligns** — Sustained excellence at a level is valued
   - [ ] Doesn't align

---

## Module 2: Understanding Levels

### 2.1 Level Differentiators

**IC Track Progression:**

| Level | Key Differentiator | Scope |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| IC1 | Learning with support | Individual tasks |
| IC2 | Independent delivery | Features/components |
| IC3 | Ownership and influence | Projects/systems |
| IC4 | Strategic impact | Organization |
| IC5 | Transformative impact | Company/industry |

**Management Track Progression:**

| Level | Key Differentiator | Scope |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| M1 | First-time manager learning fundamentals | One team |
| M2 | Independent, effective management | One team, more complex |
| M3 | Manages managers, builds capability | Multiple teams |

**Key Transitions:**

- **IC2 → IC3:** From "does good work" to "owns outcomes"
- **IC3 → IC4:** From "team impact" to "organizational impact"
- **M1 → M2:** From "learning with guidance" to "operating independently"
- **M3 → E1:** From "engineering leader" to "business leader"

### 2.2 Reading Job Descriptions

Job descriptions have three sections:

**1. Success Outcomes**
What this person accomplishes. Use these to evaluate performance.
> "Delivers complex features independently with minimal guidance"

**2. Required Skills**
Capabilities needed to achieve outcomes. Use these for development.
> "Breaks down ambiguous problems into clear tasks"

**3. Required Experience**
Background that typically prepares someone. Use these for hiring.
> "3-5 years of professional software development experience"

**For leveling decisions, focus primarily on Success Outcomes.**

### 2.3 Common Level Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|--------------|---------|
| "IC4 is just a better IC3" | IC4 has fundamentally different scope (org vs. team) |
| "Everyone should reach IC3" | IC2 is a valid, successful career level |
| "M1 is junior to IC3" | Different tracks; M1 and IC3 are peer levels |
| "Years of experience = level" | Outcomes determine level, not tenure |
| "Senior title = IC3" | Titles vary; level is about demonstrated capability |

---

### Exercise 2.1: Level Assessment Practice

Read each scenario and identify the most likely level:

**Scenario A:**
> Pat delivers assigned tasks reliably but needs guidance on approach. They ask good questions and are learning quickly. Their code requires thorough review but is improving.

Most likely level: **IC1** — Learning with support, not yet independent

**Scenario B:**
> Morgan independently owns a significant system, makes architectural decisions, mentors IC2s effectively, and is the go-to expert for their domain. They influence technical direction beyond their immediate work.

Most likely level: **IC3** — Ownership, influence, team-level impact

**Scenario C:**
> Casey identified a cross-team problem no one was addressing, built consensus among three teams, and led an initiative that improved deployment reliability company-wide. They're now defining the technical strategy for platform evolution.

Most likely level: **IC4** — Organizational impact, strategic technical leadership

---

## Module 3: Assessing Your Team

### 3.1 The Assessment Process

**Step 1: Gather Evidence**
For each team member, collect:
- Key outcomes delivered (last 6-12 months)
- Scope and complexity of their work
- Independence level (how much guidance needed)
- Impact beyond immediate tasks
- How they compare to level expectations

**Step 2: Compare to Job Descriptions**
For each person:
- Read the job description for their current level
- Ask: "Are they meeting these expectations?"
- Read adjacent levels (one above, one below)
- Ask: "Which level best matches their demonstrated outcomes?"

**Step 3: Apply the Hiring Test**
Ask yourself:
> "Would I confidently hire this person at this level from outside the company?"

- If yes → Level is probably right
- If "with reservations" → Might be over-leveled
- If "absolutely, maybe even higher" → Might be under-leveled

**Step 4: Prepare for Calibration**
Document:
- Proposed level
- 2-3 key outcomes as evidence
- Any concerns or questions
- Borderline cases to discuss

### 3.2 What to Evaluate

| Evaluate | Don't Evaluate |
|----------|---------------|
| Demonstrated outcomes | Potential |
| Sustained performance | One-time achievements |
| Current capability | Past performance at different level |
| Independence and judgment | Effort or hours worked |
| Quality of work | Tenure or years of experience |
| Scope of impact | Likability or attitude (separate issue) |

### 3.3 Common Assessment Mistakes

**Mistake 1: The Halo Effect**
> "They're great to work with, so they must be IC3."

Fix: Focus on specific outcomes, not general impressions.

**Mistake 2: Recency Bias**
> "They crushed it last month, so they're ready for IC4."

Fix: Look at 6-12 months of sustained performance.

**Mistake 3: The Squeaky Wheel**
> "They keep asking about promotion, so I should level them higher."

Fix: Level based on evidence, not advocacy.

**Mistake 4: Tenure Anchoring**
> "They've been IC2 for 3 years, so they must be IC3 by now."

Fix: Time doesn't equal capability. Evaluate outcomes.

**Mistake 5: Comparison to Stars**
> "They're not as good as Alex, so they can't be IC3."

Fix: Compare to job description, not to individuals.

### Exercise 3.1: Evidence Gathering

For one of your direct reports, complete this assessment:

```
Name: _______________________
Current Level: _______________

Key Outcomes (last 6-12 months):
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

Scope of Work:
[ ] Individual tasks  [ ] Features  [ ] Projects/Systems  [ ] Organization

Independence Level:
[ ] Needs regular guidance  [ ] Works independently  [ ] Guides others

Impact Beyond Immediate Work:
_________________________________________________

Hiring Test:
Would I hire them at this level externally?
[ ] Yes, confidently  [ ] With reservations  [ ] Absolutely, maybe higher

Proposed Level: _______________
Borderline? [ ] Yes  [ ] No

If borderline, what would tip it one way or the other?
_________________________________________________
```

## Module 4: Having Level Conversations

### 4.1 Conversation Structure

**Recommended Flow (45-60 minutes):**

| Phase | Time | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Context | 5 min | Explain the framework's purpose |
| Current Level | 10 min | Share level and rationale |
| Strengths | 10 min | What they do well at this level |
| Development | 15 min | Growth areas and opportunities |
| Questions | 10 min | Address their concerns |
| Next Steps | 5 min | Agree on follow-up |

### 4.2 Key Messages to Convey

**About the framework:**
- "This creates clarity about expectations at each level"
- "We evaluate outcomes, not tenure or potential"
- "The same standards apply across all teams"
- "Sustained excellence at any level is valued"

**About their level:**
- Be direct: "Your level is IC3"
- Provide evidence: "This is based on outcomes like X, Y, Z"
- Be specific: "What IC3 looks like is..."
- Be honest: "Areas for growth include..."

**About development:**
- "Here's what the next level requires..."
- "Here's how I can support your growth..."
- "Let's create a plan together..."

### 4.3 Handling Difficult Reactions

**"I thought I was more senior."**

Response approach:
1. Acknowledge: "I understand this isn't what you expected."
2. Evidence: "Let me share the specific outcomes we look for at [higher level]..."
3. Gap: "The main areas where I'd want to see more are..."
4. Path: "Here's what I think we can work on together..."
5. Support: "I'm committed to your growth."

**"This isn't fair."**

Response approach:
1. Listen: "Tell me more about what feels unfair."
2. Clarify: "The process we used was..."
3. Evidence: "The decision is based on..."
4. Offer: "If you have evidence I haven't considered, I want to hear it."
5. Boundaries: "The decision has been calibrated and is final, but I'm here to support you."

**"What about my compensation?"**

Response approach:
1. Separate: "Level and compensation are related but distinct."
2. Clarify: "Here's how levels connect to compensation bands..."
3. Be honest: "Here's what this means for your compensation..." (or "I need to follow up on that")
4. Don't promise: Only commit to what you can deliver.

**"I don't want to be a manager/advance."**

Response approach:
1. Affirm: "That's completely valid and respected here."
2. Value: "We need excellent [current level] engineers."
3. Explore: "What would make this role fulfilling long-term?"
4. Grow: "Let's talk about how you can continue developing within this level."

### 4.4 What NOT to Say

| Avoid | Why | Say Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| "I fought for you but calibration disagreed" | Undermines the process | "After calibration, your level is..." |
| "You'll definitely be promoted next cycle" | Promises you can't keep | "Here's what we'll work on; we'll assess readiness when the time comes" |
| "You're almost IC4" | Vague and misleading | "Here's specifically what IC4 requires and where you are on each dimension" |
| "Just keep doing what you're doing" | No development value | "Here are specific areas to focus on" |
| "Levels don't really matter" | Undermines the framework | "Levels create clarity about expectations" |

---

### Exercise 4.1: Conversation Role-Play

Practice with a peer or manager. One person plays the employee, one plays the manager.

**Scenario:** Jamie is IC2 and expected to be IC3. You need to communicate that they're IC2 with development areas around ownership and independence.

Practice:
1. Opening the conversation
2. Sharing the level with rationale
3. Discussing development areas
4. Handling pushback: "But I've been here 3 years!"
5. Closing with next steps

Debrief: What went well? What was challenging?

---

## Module 5: Calibration Participation

### 5.1 Your Role in Calibration

**Before:**
- Assess each team member against job descriptions
- Prepare evidence-based rationale (2-3 key outcomes per person)
- Identify borderline cases
- Submit pre-work on time

**During:**
- Present your team members briefly and factually
- Engage constructively in discussion
- Be open to other perspectives
- Support calibration decisions

**After:**
- Accept and implement decisions
- Communicate outcomes to your team
- Don't relitigate or undermine decisions

### 5.2 Presenting Effectively

**Good Presentation:**
> "Alex is IC3. Key evidence: They led the payments refactor end-to-end, independently handling technical design, stakeholder alignment, and delivery. They've mentored two IC2s who are now contributing independently. They're the go-to person for payment system questions across engineering."

**Poor Presentation:**
> "Alex is great. They work really hard and everyone likes them. They've been IC2 for a while so I think IC3 makes sense."

**Presentation Formula:**
1. Name and level
2. 2-3 specific outcomes that demonstrate this level
3. Any context needed
4. Flag if borderline

### 5.3 Engaging in Discussion

**Constructive:**
- "What outcomes are we seeing at IC4 level?"
- "How does this compare to the job description?"
- "I see it differently—here's the evidence I'm considering..."
- "That's a fair point. I hadn't thought about it that way."

**Not Constructive:**
- "They deserve IC4." (advocacy without evidence)
- "They're just not a fit." (vague criticism)
- "My team is different." (avoiding standards)
- "I disagree but whatever." (passive resistance)

### 5.4 After Calibration

**Do:**
- Communicate the final decision, not your original recommendation
- Present the rationale positively
- Focus on development going forward
- Support the process even if you disagreed

**Don't:**
- Tell your report "I thought you should be higher"
- Blame calibration for decisions
- Promise to "fight harder next time"
- Undermine the framework's credibility

## Module 6: Ongoing Framework Use

### 6.1 Integration with Performance Management

| Activity | How to Use the Framework |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Goal setting | Align goals to level expectations |
| 1:1s | Reference job description in development discussions |
| Performance reviews | Evaluate against level expectations |
| Promotion decisions | Use readiness assessments |
| Development planning | Use progression guides |

### 6.2 Using Progression Guides

Progression guides explain what changes between levels. Use them to:
- Explain "what got you here won't get you there"
- Identify specific development areas
- Create targeted growth plans
- Set expectations for advancement

**Example:** IC2 → IC3 Progression Guide highlights:
- From "reliable delivery" to "ownership of outcomes"
- From "following technical direction" to "setting technical direction"
- From "individual contribution" to "multiplying through others"

### 6.3 Using Readiness Assessments

Readiness assessments are checklists for promotion consideration. Use them:
- **6+ months before potential promotion:** Identify gaps early
- **During development planning:** Create targeted action items
- **Before promotion nomination:** Validate readiness
- **In promotion discussions:** Provide evidence structure

A person should meet most criteria before promotion consideration.

### 6.4 Common Scenarios

**New hire joins your team:**
- Review their level from hiring process
- Set expectations based on job description
- After 90 days, validate level through observation
- Adjust if needed (early correction is healthy)

**Team member wants promotion:**
- Review readiness assessment together
- Be honest about where they are
- Create development plan for gaps
- Set clear expectations about timeline and process

**Team member is struggling:**
- Clarify: Is this a level issue or performance issue?
- Level issue: Expectations are wrong for current capability
- Performance issue: Not meeting expectations for their level
- Address appropriately (development, support, or performance management)

**Team member is exceeding level:**
- Document the evidence
- Bring to calibration
- Don't over-promise promotion
- Ensure they're recognized even if promotion timing isn't right

## Module 7: Assessment & Next Steps

### Self-Assessment Checklist

After this training, you should be able to:

- [ ] Explain the framework's purpose to your team
- [ ] Articulate the philosophy (outcomes-based, plateauing is healthy)
- [ ] Read and interpret job descriptions
- [ ] Assess team members against level expectations
- [ ] Prepare evidence-based rationale for calibration
- [ ] Have productive leveling conversations
- [ ] Handle difficult reactions
- [ ] Participate constructively in calibration
- [ ] Use progression guides and readiness assessments
- [ ] Integrate the framework into ongoing management

### Common Manager Questions

**Q: What if I'm new and don't know my team well enough?**
A: Take time to observe (90+ days) before making level assessments. Use 1:1s to understand their work. Ask them to share key outcomes. Consult with previous manager if possible.

**Q: What if my team is all one level?**
A: This can be legitimate (specialized team) but examine carefully. Are there truly no distinctions? Are you applying levels correctly? Discuss with peers in calibration.

**Q: What if someone was mis-leveled before I became their manager?**
A: Address it honestly. Gather evidence, bring to calibration, and if adjustment is needed, communicate thoughtfully. Early correction is better than prolonged misalignment.

**Q: How do I balance being supportive with being honest about levels?**
A: Honesty IS supportive. False hope or vague feedback doesn't help anyone grow. Be direct, be kind, be specific, and be committed to their development.
