# Implementation Rollout Playbook

## Overview

This playbook provides a structured approach for introducing the leveling framework to your organization. A successful rollout requires careful planning, clear communication, and sustained commitment from leadership.

**Why This Matters:** A poorly executed rollout can undermine even the best-designed framework. Conversely, a thoughtful implementation builds trust, creates clarity, and establishes the foundation for fair, consistent talent decisions.

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the rollout, ensure the following are in place:

### Executive Alignment
- [ ] Executive sponsor identified (typically VP Engineering or CTO)
- [ ] Executive team aligned on the framework's purpose and philosophy
- [ ] Commitment to apply the framework consistently, including at senior levels
- [ ] Agreement on timeline and resource allocation

### Framework Readiness
- [ ] Job descriptions finalized for all levels you're implementing
- [ ] Progression guides and readiness assessments ready
- [ ] Compensation bands aligned to levels (or plan to address separately)
- [ ] Interview scorecards ready (if using for hiring)

### Organizational Readiness
- [ ] HR/People team briefed and aligned
- [ ] Manager capacity confirmed (rollout takes time)
- [ ] Communication channels identified
- [ ] Feedback mechanisms planned

---

## Rollout Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-4 weeks)

**Objective:** Prepare leadership and establish the groundwork.

#### 1.1 Executive Briefing

Present to the executive team:
- Framework philosophy and design principles
- How levels connect to business outcomes
- Expected benefits and realistic timeline
- Resource requirements and leadership commitment needed

**Key Messages:**
- This is about clarity and fairness, not bureaucracy
- The framework describes what success looks like at each level
- Plateauing at IC3/M2 is healthy and valued—not everyone needs to advance
- Consistency matters more than perfection

#### 1.2 Manager Training (First Wave)

Train senior managers and directors first:
- Framework philosophy and structure
- How to use job descriptions and progression guides
- Level calibration principles
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- How to communicate with their teams

**Training Format:**
- 2-3 hour workshop (can be split across sessions)
- Include hands-on exercises (e.g., level hypothetical employees)
- Provide reference materials for ongoing use
- Schedule follow-up Q&A session

#### 1.3 Level Mapping Preparation

Before communicating broadly, leadership should:
- Draft initial level mappings for all current employees
- Identify any potential concerns or edge cases
- Prepare talking points for difficult conversations
- Align on any compensation implications

**Important:** Do NOT communicate individual levels to employees yet. This comes later.

---

### Phase 2: Manager Enablement (2-3 weeks)

**Objective:** Equip all managers to use the framework effectively.

#### 2.1 Full Manager Training

Extend training to all people managers:
- Same content as senior manager training
- Additional focus on day-to-day application
- How to have leveling conversations with reports
- How to use readiness assessments for development planning

#### 2.2 Manager Calibration Sessions

Conduct calibration sessions by function or organization:
- Managers present level recommendations for their teams
- Cross-team discussion ensures consistency
- Resolve edge cases and borderline situations
- Document decisions and rationale

**Calibration Ground Rules:**
- Focus on outcomes and evidence, not tenure or potential
- "Would I hire this person at this level externally?"
- It's okay to disagree—that's how calibration works
- Decisions should be defensible with the job description

#### 2.3 Prepare Individual Communication Plans

For each employee, managers should prepare:
- Current level (with rationale)
- Key strengths at current level
- Development areas (if any)
- Next-level readiness (if applicable)

**Handle with Care:**
- Employees who may feel over-leveled
- Employees expecting a higher level
- Long-tenured employees at lower levels than expected
- Anyone with compensation implications

---

### Phase 3: Organization Communication (1-2 weeks)

**Objective:** Announce the framework to all employees.

#### 3.1 All-Hands Announcement

Executive sponsor presents to the organization:
- Why we're implementing a leveling framework
- Framework philosophy (outcome-based, growth-oriented)
- What employees can expect (clarity, fairness, development support)
- Timeline for individual conversations
- How to ask questions or provide feedback

**Sample Messaging:**

> "We're introducing a leveling framework to create clarity about what success looks like at every level of our organization. This isn't about ranking people or creating hierarchy—it's about ensuring everyone understands expectations, has clear paths for growth, and is evaluated fairly and consistently.
>
> The framework is outcome-based: it describes what you accomplish, not just what you do. It values sustained excellence at any level—advancing isn't required to be successful here. Over the coming weeks, your manager will meet with you to discuss where you are in the framework and how we can support your growth."

#### 3.2 Documentation Access

Make framework materials available to all employees:
- Job descriptions for all levels
- Career progression overviews
- Progression guides (for those interested in advancement)
- FAQ document

**Access Approach:**
- Central location (wiki, intranet, or documentation site)
- Easy to navigate and search
- Clear about what's for reference vs. what requires manager involvement

#### 3.3 FAQ and Support Channels

Establish ways for employees to get questions answered:
- FAQ document addressing common concerns
- Office hours with HR/People team
- Manager as primary point of contact
- Escalation path for unresolved concerns

---

### Phase 4: Individual Conversations (2-4 weeks)

**Objective:** Every employee understands their level and development path.

#### 4.1 Manager-Employee Conversations

Each manager meets with their direct reports to discuss:
- Current level and what it means
- Evidence supporting the level assignment
- Strengths demonstrated at this level
- Development areas and growth opportunities
- Next-level readiness (if interested in advancing)

**Conversation Structure (45-60 minutes):**

1. **Context (5 min):** Explain the framework's purpose and philosophy
2. **Current Level (10 min):** Share level and supporting rationale
3. **Strengths (10 min):** Highlight what they're doing well
4. **Development (15 min):** Discuss growth areas and opportunities
5. **Questions (10 min):** Address concerns and questions
6. **Next Steps (5 min):** Agree on follow-up actions

**Handling Difficult Conversations:**

*"I thought I was more senior"*
- Acknowledge their perspective
- Focus on specific outcomes and evidence
- Explain what senior-level looks like with examples
- Discuss concrete steps toward advancement if desired

*"What does this mean for my compensation?"*
- Be prepared with your organization's approach
- If compensation isn't changing, say so clearly
- If adjustments are planned, explain timeline
- Don't make promises you can't keep

*"I don't want to advance—is that okay?"*
- Absolutely affirm this is valued
- Emphasize sustained excellence matters
- Discuss how to continue growing within level
- Thank them for the clarity

#### 4.2 Document Outcomes

After conversations, managers should document:
- Level confirmed and communicated
- Key development areas discussed
- Any commitments made
- Follow-up needed

#### 4.3 Escalation Handling

For employees who disagree with their level:
1. Manager listens and considers additional evidence
2. If disagreement persists, involve skip-level or HR
3. Consider additional calibration if warranted
4. Final decision rests with management, communicated respectfully

---

### Phase 5: Integration (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Embed the framework into regular operations.

#### 5.1 Connect to Performance Management

Integrate levels with performance reviews:
- Self-assessments reference job description expectations
- Manager assessments evaluate against level expectations
- Performance ratings consider level-appropriate outcomes
- Promotion decisions use readiness assessments

#### 5.2 Connect to Hiring

Use the framework in recruiting:
- Job postings aligned to levels
- Interview scorecards evaluate level-appropriate competencies
- Offer levels calibrated against internal benchmarks
- New hire onboarding includes level expectations

#### 5.3 Connect to Compensation

Align compensation practices:
- Bands associated with levels
- Promotion criteria include level advancement
- Within-level progression has clear guidelines
- Annual reviews consider level performance

#### 5.4 Ongoing Calibration

Establish regular calibration rhythms:
- Quarterly or semi-annual calibration sessions
- Cross-team consistency checks
- New hire level validation after 90 days
- Annual framework review and updates

### All-Hands Announcement Email

```
Subject: Introducing Our Engineering Leveling Framework

Team,

I'm excited to share that we're rolling out an engineering leveling framework
across the organization. This framework creates clarity about what success
looks like at every level—from Associate Engineer to CTO.

**Why are we doing this?**

As we've grown, we've heard consistent feedback that expectations aren't
always clear, career paths feel undefined, and leveling decisions can seem
inconsistent. This framework addresses those concerns directly.

**What does it include?**

- Clear job descriptions for every level (IC1-IC5, M1-M3, E1-E3)
- Progression guides explaining what it takes to advance
- Readiness assessments for promotion decisions
- Performance management aligned to level expectations

**Key principles:**

1. **Outcome-based:** We evaluate what you accomplish, not just what you do
2. **Growth-oriented:** Development and advancement are actively supported
3. **Plateau-friendly:** Sustained excellence at any level is valued—not
   everyone needs to advance, and that's completely fine

**What happens next?**

Over the next few weeks:
- All framework materials will be available at [location]
- Your manager will schedule time to discuss your level and development
- We'll have office hours for questions on [dates]

This is about creating clarity and fairness for everyone. Thank you for
your patience as we roll this out thoughtfully.

[Executive Sponsor]
```

### Manager Communication to Team

```
Subject: Leveling Framework - Our Team Discussion

Team,

You've heard about the new leveling framework from [Executive]. I wanted
to follow up with what this means for our team.

**Over the next two weeks, I'll be meeting with each of you individually to:**

- Explain how the framework works
- Discuss your current level and what it means
- Talk about your strengths and development areas
- Answer any questions you have

**A few things I want you to know:**

- This isn't about ranking or comparing people
- Your level reflects your current impact, not your potential or value
- I'm committed to your growth, whatever that looks like for you
- Nothing about your job or compensation is changing as a result of this
  conversation (unless we explicitly discuss otherwise)

I'll be reaching out to schedule our conversation. In the meantime,
feel free to review the framework materials at [location].

[Manager]
```

### Individual Level Communication

```
Discussion Guide for Managers

Opening:
"Thanks for making time for this conversation. As you know, we're rolling
out the leveling framework, and I wanted to discuss what this means for you
specifically."

Sharing the level:
"Based on the work you've been doing and the outcomes you've delivered,
your level in the framework is [Level]. Let me share some specifics about
why this makes sense..."

Discussing strengths:
"Here's what I see you doing well at this level: [specific examples].
These are real strengths that contribute to the team's success."

Discussing development:
"Looking at the [Level] job description, some areas where I'd love to see
you continue growing are: [specific areas]. Here are some ideas for how
we might work on those together..."

Closing:
"What questions do you have? ... How are you feeling about this? ...
Let's plan to check in on your development in our next 1:1."
```

## Change Management Considerations

### Anticipate Resistance

**Common concerns and responses:**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "This is just bureaucracy" | "The framework creates clarity and consistency. It's a tool for fairness, not a constraint on your work." |
| "I've been here X years, I should be higher" | "Levels reflect current impact, not tenure. Let's discuss what senior-level outcomes look like." |
| "This will create unhealthy competition" | "We're evaluating against expectations, not against each other. Multiple people can be high performers." |
| "My title doesn't match my level" | "We can discuss title alignment separately. The level reflects expectations and scope." |
| "What about my unique situation?" | "The framework accommodates different paths. Let's talk through your specific situation." |

### Success Factors

What makes rollouts succeed:

1. **Executive commitment** — Leaders use the framework themselves and hold others accountable
2. **Manager capability** — Managers are trained and supported to have good conversations
3. **Consistent application** — The framework applies to everyone, including senior leaders
4. **Patient iteration** — Expect to refine the approach based on feedback
5. **Clear communication** — Repeat key messages frequently; over-communicate

### Warning Signs

Watch for these indicators of trouble:

- Managers avoiding leveling conversations
- Widespread disagreement with level assignments
- Framework language not appearing in performance discussions
- Hiring decisions ignoring the framework
- Senior leaders exempting themselves
- Employees feeling the process was unfair

### Course Correction

If issues emerge:

1. **Gather specific feedback** — What exactly isn't working?
2. **Acknowledge the concern** — Don't be defensive
3. **Assess root cause** — Is it the framework or the implementation?
4. **Make targeted adjustments** — Don't overhaul; iterate
5. **Communicate changes** — Show you're listening and improving
