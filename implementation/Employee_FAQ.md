# Employee FAQ: Leveling Framework

## Overview

This FAQ answers common questions about our leveling framework. The framework creates clarity about what's expected at each level, how to grow, and how decisions are made.

---

## Understanding the Framework

### What is the leveling framework?

The leveling framework defines what success looks like at each level in our organization. It includes:

- **Job descriptions** for each level (what you're expected to accomplish)
- **Progression guides** (how to grow from one level to the next)
- **Readiness assessments** (checklists for promotion consideration)

The framework covers Individual Contributors (IC1-IC5), Managers (M1-M3), and Executives (E1-E3).

### Why do we have levels?

Levels create:
- **Clarity:** You know what's expected of you
- **Fairness:** The same standards apply to everyone
- **Growth paths:** Clear understanding of how to advance
- **Consistency:** Decisions are made the same way across teams

### How is this different from titles?

**Level** reflects scope, impact, and expectations—it's calibrated across the organization.

**Title** is what appears on your business card or LinkedIn. Titles may vary slightly by team or preference, but level is consistent.

If there's ever a mismatch, level is the source of truth for expectations and compensation.

### What are the levels?

**Individual Contributor Track:**
| Level | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| IC1 | Associate Engineer | Learning with support |
| IC2 | Software Engineer | Independent delivery |
| IC3 | Senior Engineer | Ownership and influence |
| IC4 | Staff Engineer | Organizational impact |
| IC5 | Distinguished Engineer | Company/industry impact |

**Management Track:**
| Level | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| M1 | Engineering Manager | First-level manager |
| M2 | Senior Engineering Manager | Independent, effective management |
| M3 | Head of Engineering | Manages managers |

**Executive Track:**
| Level | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| E1 | Director of Engineering | Domain ownership |
| E2 | Senior Director | Cross-domain leadership |
| E3 | CTO | Company technology leadership |

## Your Level

### How do I find out my level?

Your manager will discuss your level with you. If you haven't had this conversation, ask your manager.

### How was my level determined?

Your level is based on the outcomes you consistently deliver, compared to the expectations in the job description for each level. The process includes:

1. Your manager assesses your work against job descriptions
2. Managers calibrate together to ensure consistency
3. Levels are confirmed and communicated

### What if I think my level is wrong?

Talk to your manager and share your perspective with specific examples. Good questions to discuss:
- "What outcomes would you expect to see at [level you think you should be]?"
- "Here are examples of my work that I think demonstrate [higher level]..."
- "What gaps do you see between my current work and [higher level]?"

If you still disagree after this conversation, you can ask to escalate to your skip-level manager or HR.

### Does my level affect my compensation?

Yes. Each level has an associated compensation band. Your level determines which band you're in; where you fall within the band depends on factors like performance, experience, and market data.

### Can my level change?

Yes, through:
- **Promotion:** Advancing to the next level (requires demonstrated readiness)
- **Adjustment:** Correcting a misalignment (rare, but happens if someone was incorrectly leveled)

Levels are reviewed during calibration cycles, typically annually or semi-annually.

## Career Growth

### How do I get promoted?

Promotion requires **sustained demonstration** of the next level's expectations. The process:

1. **Understand the next level:** Review the job description and progression guide
2. **Identify gaps:** Use the readiness assessment with your manager
3. **Develop:** Work on specific areas over time (not a quick sprint)
4. **Demonstrate:** Consistently deliver next-level outcomes for 6+ months
5. **Calibrate:** Your manager nominates you; calibration confirms readiness
6. **Promote:** If confirmed, you're promoted

### How long does it take to get promoted?

There's no fixed timeline. Promotion depends on demonstrated capability, not time at level. Some people advance quickly; others stay at a level for years (which is completely fine).

Very fast promotions (under 1 year at level) are unusual and require strong evidence. Very long times at one level may warrant a conversation about development or career goals.

### What if I don't want to be promoted?

That's completely valid. The framework values sustained excellence at every level. IC3 (Senior Engineer) is a successful career destination—not everyone needs to be Staff or Distinguished.

If you want to stay at your current level:
- You're still valued and recognized
- You can continue growing within your level
- There are still opportunities for increased compensation within your band
- This is a respected choice, not a failure

### Can I switch from IC to management (or vice versa)?

Yes. The framework supports both paths:

**IC → Management:** If you're interested in people leadership, talk to your manager about opportunities to practice (mentoring, leading projects). The M1 job description shows what management requires.

**Management → IC:** If management isn't right for you, returning to IC is respected. Your level would be determined by your demonstrated IC capabilities.

### What's the difference between IC3 and IC4?

This is a common question because it's a significant jump:

| IC3 (Senior) | IC4 (Staff) |
|--------------|-------------|
| Owns outcomes for their team | Impacts multiple teams or the organization |
| Influences within their team | Influences across teams without authority |
| Solves complex problems | Identifies which problems to solve |
| Mentors individuals | Develops senior engineers toward Staff |
| Technical expert in their area | Strategic technical leader |

IC4 isn't just "better at IC3 things"—it's a different scope of impact and influence.

### What's the difference between IC and Management?

**IC track:** Impact through technical contribution, influence, and expertise
**Management track:** Impact through developing people and building teams

Neither is "higher" than the other. IC4 and M2 are peer levels with different types of impact.

Choose based on what energizes you:
- Do you want to spend your time on technical problems or people problems?
- Do you get satisfaction from writing code or from helping others grow?
- Do you want to influence through expertise or through organizational leadership?

## How Decisions Are Made

### What is calibration?

Calibration is a process where managers meet to ensure levels are applied consistently. They:
- Review employees at each level across teams
- Discuss borderline cases
- Ensure an IC3 on one team is comparable to an IC3 on another team

This prevents one manager from having a higher or lower bar than others.

### Who decides my level?

Your manager makes the initial assessment. Calibration (with peer managers and HR) confirms it. This ensures decisions aren't based solely on one person's judgment.

### How do I know if I'm being evaluated fairly?

The framework helps ensure fairness through:
- **Transparent criteria:** Job descriptions are available to everyone
- **Calibration:** Multiple perspectives, not just your manager's
- **Evidence-based:** Decisions require specific outcomes, not just opinions
- **Consistency:** Same standards across teams

If you feel you're not being evaluated fairly, raise it with your manager first, then escalate to skip-level or HR if needed.

### Can I see the job description for my level?

Yes. All job descriptions, progression guides, and readiness assessments are available to you. Ask your manager where to find them, or check our documentation site.

## Common Concerns

### I've been at my level for a long time. Is something wrong?

Not necessarily. Long tenure at a level can mean:
- You're excelling at a level that's right for you (great!)
- You haven't yet demonstrated next-level outcomes (development opportunity)
- You're not interested in advancing (valid choice)
- There's a gap in support or opportunity (worth discussing)

Talk to your manager about your goals. If you want to advance, ask what specifically you'd need to demonstrate.

### My friend at another company has a higher title. Am I under-leveled?

Titles vary wildly between companies. "Senior Engineer" at one company might be "Staff" at another, or vice versa. External titles aren't directly comparable.

What matters is whether your level accurately reflects your demonstrated outcomes against our framework.

### Someone on another team does similar work but is a higher level. Is that fair?

It might be, or it might not. Consider:
- Is the work actually the same scope and complexity?
- Are they demonstrating outcomes you're not seeing?
- Was there a calibration gap that should be addressed?

If you're concerned, raise it with your manager. Calibration exists specifically to catch these inconsistencies.

### I was a higher level at my previous company. Why am I lower here?

Levels don't transfer directly between companies. When you joined, you were leveled based on interview performance against our framework.

After joining, your level can be validated or adjusted based on demonstrated work. If you believe you're operating at a higher level than where you were placed, gather evidence and discuss with your manager.

### Does this mean I have to compete with my coworkers?

No. The framework evaluates you against the job description, not against other people. Multiple people can be excellent IC3s. This isn't a ranking system or forced distribution.

Your success doesn't depend on someone else's failure.

## Development Questions

### How do I know what to work on to advance?

1. **Review the next level's job description:** What outcomes does it require?
2. **Use the readiness assessment:** Which criteria do you already meet? Which are gaps?
3. **Talk to your manager:** Get their perspective on your biggest development areas
4. **Create a plan:** Focus on 1-2 specific areas at a time

### Can I see examples of what the next level looks like?

Talk to your manager about:
- What specific outcomes would demonstrate next-level work?
- Are there people at that level whose work I could learn from?
- What projects or opportunities would help me develop?

### My manager doesn't seem to understand my work. How can they assess my level?

If your manager lacks context on your work:
1. **Share more:** Keep them informed of your accomplishments and impact
2. **Provide evidence:** Document key outcomes and contributions
3. **Invite perspective:** Ask them to attend relevant meetings or reviews
4. **Give feedback:** Let them know you'd like more engagement

This is important for your development conversations and accurate leveling.

### What resources are available to help me grow?

- **Job descriptions:** What's expected at your level and the next
- **Progression guides:** What changes between levels
- **Readiness assessments:** Checklists for promotion consideration
- **Your manager:** For coaching, feedback, and opportunities
- **Performance reviews:** Regular feedback against level expectations
- **Mentorship:** Seek mentors at or above your target level

## Framework Philosophy

### Why does the framework say "plateauing is okay"?

Because it is. Our industry sometimes implies everyone should constantly advance, but:
- Not everyone wants to be a Staff Engineer or VP
- Sustained excellence at IC3 is valuable and difficult
- Organizations need great people at every level
- Career satisfaction doesn't require constant promotion

Choosing to stay at a level isn't failure—it's a valid, respected choice.

### What does "outcome-based" mean?

We evaluate what you **accomplish**, not just what you **do**.

| Activity (What You Do) | Outcome (What You Accomplish) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Write code | Deliver features that solve user problems |
| Attend meetings | Influence decisions that improve the product |
| Review PRs | Improve code quality and help others grow |
| Work long hours | (Not evaluated—outcomes matter, not hours) |

### What if I'm struggling at my current level?

If you're not meeting the expectations for your level:
1. **Acknowledge it:** Have an honest conversation with your manager
2. **Understand gaps:** What specifically is falling short?
3. **Get support:** What do you need to succeed?
4. **Create a plan:** Focus on specific improvements
5. **Track progress:** Regular check-ins with your manager

Struggling doesn't mean you'll be demoted—it means there's work to do. Most situations improve with clarity and support.
