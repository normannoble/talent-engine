## General Framework Questions

### What is this leveling framework?

The leveling framework defines what success looks like at each level of our organization—from IC1 (Associate Engineer) through IC5 (Distinguished Engineer) on the individual contributor track, M1-M3 on the management track, and E1-E3 on the executive track.

Each level has a job description that outlines:
- **Success Outcomes:** What you accomplish at this level
- **Required Skills:** Capabilities needed to achieve those outcomes
- **Required Experience:** Background that typically prepares someone for this level

### Why are we using this framework?

The framework creates:
- **Clarity:** Everyone understands what's expected at their level
- **Fairness:** Consistent standards across teams and managers
- **Growth paths:** Clear progression from one level to the next
- **Better conversations:** Shared language for feedback and development

### How is this different from what we did before?

Previously, leveling decisions may have been inconsistent across teams, based on tenure or title rather than outcomes, or unclear to employees. This framework:
- Anchors levels to demonstrated outcomes, not tenure
- Applies the same standards across all teams
- Makes expectations transparent and documented
- Provides tools for development conversations

### Is this framework set in stone?

No. The framework will evolve based on feedback and organizational needs. However, changes go through a review process to maintain consistency. If you have suggestions, raise them with HR or your leadership.

## Leveling Decisions

### How do I determine someone's level?

Compare their demonstrated outcomes to the job description for each level. Ask yourself:
1. What outcomes has this person consistently delivered?
2. Which level's expectations best match those outcomes?
3. Would I confidently hire this person at this level externally?

Focus on **sustained performance**, not peaks or potential.

### What if someone is between levels?

If someone is genuinely between levels, they're likely at the lower level with development areas for the next. True "in-between" is rare—usually one level is a better fit.

Ask: "Are they consistently meeting ALL expectations for the higher level?" If not, they're at the lower level.

### How do tenure and years of experience factor in?

They don't directly determine level. Someone with 10 years of experience might be IC3; someone with 4 years might be IC4. What matters is **demonstrated outcomes**, not time served.

Experience requirements in job descriptions are guidelines for hiring, not deterministic for current employees.

### Can someone be demoted/down-leveled?

Levels should reflect current, sustained capability. If someone was over-leveled or their performance has declined significantly, a level adjustment may be appropriate. This is rare and requires:
- Clear evidence and documentation
- Calibration with peers and HR
- Thoughtful, compassionate communication
- Usually tied to a performance improvement process

### What if I disagree with a calibration decision?

Raise your concern in the calibration meeting with specific evidence. If the decision stands and you still disagree:
1. Document your perspective
2. Escalate to your manager or HR
3. Accept the decision once finalized—don't relitigate with your team

Calibration works because we commit to decisions even when we disagree.

### How do I handle a new hire whose level seems wrong?

After 90 days, you should have enough information to validate the hire level. If it seems wrong:
1. Document specific evidence
2. Raise it in new hire calibration or with HR
3. Adjust if warranted—early correction is healthy

Don't wait until annual review to address a leveling mismatch.

## Talking to Your Team

### How do I communicate someone's level?

Be direct and evidence-based:
1. Explain the framework's purpose (clarity, fairness, growth)
2. Share their level and the rationale (specific outcomes)
3. Discuss strengths at this level
4. Discuss development areas
5. Answer questions openly

See the [Rollout Playbook](Implementation_Rollout_Playbook.md) for detailed scripts.

### What if someone disagrees with their level?

Listen to their perspective and ask for specific evidence. If they raise valid points you hadn't considered:
- Thank them for the input
- Commit to reviewing with HR/calibration if warranted
- Follow up with a clear answer

If their level is correct:
- Acknowledge their feelings
- Reiterate the evidence for the current level
- Focus the conversation on development
- Be clear that the decision stands

### How do I tell someone they're not ready for promotion?

Be honest and specific:
1. Acknowledge their desire to advance
2. Explain what the next level requires (reference the job description)
3. Share specific gaps between their current work and next-level expectations
4. Create a concrete development plan together
5. Commit to supporting their growth

Avoid: "Maybe next cycle" without specifics, or vague encouragement that creates false hope.

### What if someone doesn't want to advance?

That's completely valid and should be celebrated. Not everyone wants or needs to advance. Sustained excellence at any level is valuable.

Affirm their choice:
- "That's a great choice, and we value your contributions at this level."
- "Let's talk about how you can continue growing and staying engaged here."
- "What would make this role fulfilling for you long-term?"

### How do I talk about levels without creating unhealthy competition?

Emphasize that:
- Levels reflect expectations, not rankings
- Multiple people can excel at the same level
- We evaluate against job descriptions, not against each other
- Advancement is one path; sustained excellence is another

Avoid comparing team members to each other. Compare everyone to the job description.

## Performance & Development

### How does the framework connect to performance reviews?

Performance reviews assess how well someone is meeting the expectations for their level. The job description defines those expectations.

- **Meeting expectations:** Solid performance at level
- **Exceeding expectations:** Consistently going beyond level requirements
- **Below expectations:** Not meeting level requirements

Level and performance rating are related but distinct. You can be a high-performing IC2 or an underperforming IC3.

### How do I use the framework for development conversations?

Use progression guides and readiness assessments:
1. Review current level job description together
2. Identify strengths and development areas at current level
3. If they want to advance, review next-level requirements
4. Use readiness assessment to identify gaps
5. Create a development plan targeting specific outcomes

### Can someone be promoted mid-cycle?

Generally, promotions happen during defined promotion cycles to ensure calibration and fairness. Exceptions are rare and require:
- Clear, sustained demonstration of next-level performance
- Business need for the role
- Calibration with peers
- HR and leadership approval

Avoid: Promoting someone because they're threatening to leave or because of a single achievement.

### What if someone is high-performing but not promotable?

This is normal and healthy. Being excellent at IC3 doesn't automatically mean ready for IC4. The skills and scope are different.

- Recognize and reward their contributions at current level
- Discuss what fulfillment looks like without promotion
- Explore lateral growth, new challenges, or expanded scope within level
- Be honest if next-level isn't a fit

### How long should someone be at a level before promotion?

There's no fixed timeline. What matters is sustained demonstration of next-level capability. However:
- Very fast promotions (< 1 year) should be scrutinized carefully
- Very slow progressions (5+ years at same level) may warrant discussion
- Some people will stay at a level permanently, and that's fine

## Common Situations

### I have a team member who was a senior engineer at their last company but is IC2 here. How do I handle this?

External titles don't translate directly. What matters is demonstrated capability against our framework.

- Explain that levels are calibrated to our specific expectations
- Focus on their path forward: "Here's what IC3 looks like here"
- Avoid apologizing for your standards
- If they consistently perform at a higher level, adjust through calibration

### One of my ICs wants to try management. How does the framework help?

The framework includes both tracks. For IC-to-management transitions:
1. Review the M1 job description together
2. Discuss whether they're drawn to people leadership specifically
3. Identify opportunities to practice management skills (mentoring, leading projects)
4. Be honest about whether management is right for them
5. Use the progression guide for IC3 → M1 transition if applicable

### I inherited a team with inconsistent leveling. What do I do?

This is common. Approach it systematically:
1. Assess each person against the job descriptions
2. Identify potential misalignments
3. Bring to calibration with evidence
4. Adjust levels where warranted (through proper process)
5. Communicate changes thoughtfully

Don't rush—take time to understand each person's work before making changes.

### How do I level someone in a specialized or unique role?

The framework is designed to be broad enough to cover variations. Focus on:
- Scope and impact (team, org, company)
- Independence and judgment required
- Complexity of problems solved
- Influence and leadership

If the role truly doesn't fit, work with HR to determine appropriate leveling or whether a separate track is needed.

### What about contractors or temporary employees?

Generally, contractors aren't formally leveled but should be engaged at an appropriate level of scope and expectation. If you're evaluating a contractor for conversion:
- Assess them against the framework as you would any candidate
- Don't automatically convert at the "level" they were engaged
- Make an independent leveling decision based on demonstrated outcomes

## Compensation Questions

### Does level determine compensation?

Levels have associated compensation bands. Your level determines your band; where you fall within the band depends on other factors (performance, experience, market data).

### What if someone's compensation doesn't match their level?

This can happen, especially during framework rollout. Work with HR to:
- Understand the gap and its cause
- Develop a plan to address it (if appropriate)
- Communicate transparently with the employee

Don't promise compensation changes you can't deliver.

### Can someone get a raise without a promotion?

Yes. Within-level progression recognizes growth and sustained performance without requiring advancement to the next level. Work with HR on your organization's within-band progression policies.

## Calibration Questions

### What is my role in calibration?

You're responsible for:
- Preparing evidence-based rationale for each team member's level
- Presenting your team in calibration sessions
- Engaging constructively in discussion
- Accepting and implementing calibration decisions
- Communicating outcomes to your team

### What if calibration changes my recommendation?

That's calibration working as intended. The purpose is to catch inconsistencies.

- Understand the rationale for the change
- Communicate the final decision (not your original recommendation) to your team
- Don't undermine the process by saying "I thought you should be higher but..."

### How do I present effectively in calibration?

Come prepared with:
- Specific outcomes and evidence for each person
- Clear articulation of why this level (not just "they're great")
- Awareness of borderline cases
- Openness to other perspectives

Avoid:
- Advocacy mode ("fighting" for your people)
- Vague rationale ("they work hard")
- Comparing to specific individuals on other teams

---

## Framework Philosophy

### Why does the framework say plateauing is okay?

Because it is. Our industry often implies everyone should constantly advance, but:
- Not everyone wants to be a Staff Engineer or Manager
- Sustained excellence at IC3 is valuable and difficult
- Organizations need strong performers at every level
- Career satisfaction doesn't require constant promotion

The framework values depth and mastery, not just advancement.

### What's the difference between level and title?

Level reflects scope, impact, and expectations. Title is what appears on a business card or LinkedIn.

- Levels should be consistent (an IC3 is an IC3 everywhere)
- Titles may vary by team or preference ("Senior Engineer" vs "Senior SWE")
- If title and level are misaligned, level is the source of truth

### How does this framework compare to other companies?

Our levels are calibrated to our context. External comparisons are imprecise because:
- Different companies have different expectations at each level
- Titles vary widely (one company's "Senior" is another's "Staff")
- Scope and impact depend on company size and stage

We aim for our levels to be rigorous and externally credible, but direct mapping isn't possible.

### What if I think the framework itself is wrong?

Feedback is welcome through appropriate channels:
- Raise specific concerns with HR or leadership
- Provide concrete examples of what's not working
- Propose alternatives, not just criticism

Until the framework changes, apply it consistently. Selective application undermines trust.
