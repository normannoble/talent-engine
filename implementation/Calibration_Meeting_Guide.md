# Calibration Meeting Guide

## Overview

Calibration meetings ensure consistent application of the leveling framework across teams and managers. Without calibration, individual managers may interpret levels differently, leading to inequity and erosion of trust in the system.

**Purpose of Calibration:**
- Ensure consistent leveling standards across teams
- Surface and resolve edge cases
- Build shared understanding of what each level looks like
- Identify potential over- or under-leveling
- Create accountability for leveling decisions

**When to Calibrate:**
- During initial framework rollout
- Before performance review cycles
- Before promotion decisions are finalized
- When new managers join
- Quarterly or semi-annually as ongoing practice

---

## Types of Calibration Sessions

### 1. Level Calibration
**Purpose:** Ensure employees are at the right level
**Frequency:** Semi-annually or annually
**Participants:** Managers within a function, HR partner, facilitator

### 2. Performance Calibration
**Purpose:** Ensure performance ratings are consistent
**Frequency:** Each performance cycle
**Participants:** Managers within a function, HR partner, facilitator

### 3. Promotion Calibration
**Purpose:** Validate promotion recommendations
**Frequency:** Each promotion cycle
**Participants:** Senior leaders, HR partner, facilitator

### 4. New Hire Calibration
**Purpose:** Validate new hire leveling after 90 days
**Frequency:** Quarterly or as needed
**Participants:** Hiring managers, HR partner

This guide focuses primarily on **Level Calibration**, with notes on adapting for other types.

## Running the Meeting

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Set Context
"Today we're calibrating levels across [scope]. Our goal is to ensure we're applying the framework consistently—that an IC3 on Team A looks like an IC3 on Team B. This isn't about ranking people against each other; it's about ensuring everyone is evaluated against the same standard."

#### Review Ground Rules

**Present and review these principles:**

1. **Evidence-based:** Decisions must be supported by specific outcomes and examples, not feelings or potential.

2. **Level-anchored:** Compare each person to the job description expectations, not to other individuals.

3. **Honest assessment:** This is not advocacy time. We're seeking accuracy, not arguing for our people.

4. **Current state:** We're calibrating on demonstrated, sustained performance—not potential or trajectory.

5. **Confidential:** Discussion stays in the room. We'll communicate decisions appropriately afterward.

6. **Decisions are binding:** Once we calibrate, levels are set. Changes require re-calibration.

#### The Calibration Question
Ask managers to consider: *"Would I confidently hire this person at this level from outside the company?"*

If the answer is "no" or "with reservations," the level may be wrong.

---

### Level-by-Level Calibration (90-120 minutes)

#### Order of Discussion
Start with the most populated level (usually IC3 or IC2), then work outward:
1. IC3 (establish the anchor)
2. IC2
3. IC4
4. IC1
5. IC5 (if applicable)
6. Repeat for management track if in scope

#### For Each Level

**Step 1: Manager Presentations (2-3 min per person)**

Each manager briefly presents their employees at this level:
- Name and role
- Key outcomes that demonstrate this level
- Any context needed

**Example presentation:**
> "Alex Chen, IC3. Key outcomes: Led the authentication refactor end-to-end, mentored two IC2s through their first major projects, and has been the go-to person for security questions across the team. Consistently delivers complex work independently with minimal guidance."

**Step 2: Group Discussion (as needed)**

After presentations, the group discusses:
- Does everyone agree these are IC3-level outcomes?
- Are there any that seem higher or lower?
- Are there inconsistencies across teams?

**Step 3: Calibration Decisions**

For each person, confirm one of:
- **Confirmed at level:** Group agrees the level is appropriate
- **Needs discussion:** Potential concern; deeper dive needed
- **Level adjustment:** Group agrees level should change

#### Facilitator Techniques

**Drawing out concerns:**
- "Any reactions to what you've heard?"
- "Does anyone see this differently?"
- "How does this compare to [similar person on another team]?"

**Handling disagreement:**
- "Let's hear the specific evidence on both sides."
- "What would we need to see to be confident in [higher/lower] level?"
- "Is this a level issue or a performance issue?"

**Keeping on track:**
- "Let's table that for edge cases and move on."
- "We're spending a lot of time here—what's the core question?"
- "Can we agree on the level and note the development area separately?"

**Managing time:**
- Quick confirmations should be quick (30 seconds)
- Budget 5-10 minutes for genuine discussions
- Use a "parking lot" for complex cases

---

### Cross-Cutting Discussion (20 minutes)

After calibrating individual levels, discuss patterns:

#### Questions to Explore

**Consistency:**
- "Looking across teams, are our IC3s comparable?"
- "Is any team systematically higher or lower than others?"
- "Are we seeing the same bar for [competency] across teams?"

**Distribution:**
- "Does our level distribution make sense for our organization?"
- "Are there levels with too few or too many people?"
- "Do we have appropriate senior/junior ratios?"

**Trends:**
- "Are we seeing common development themes at any level?"
- "Are there systemic issues we should address?"
- "What's working well in how we're applying the framework?"

#### Common Patterns to Watch For

| Pattern | Potential Issue | Discussion Prompt |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| All IC3s on one team, mix on others | Manager may have higher/lower bar | "What does IC2 vs IC3 look like on Team X?" |
| No IC4s anywhere | Bar may be too high, or we're not recognizing staff-level work | "Who's closest to IC4? What's missing?" |
| New hires consistently higher than tenured employees | External hiring bar may differ from internal | "Are we applying the same standard?" |
| One team has much higher average level | Could be legitimate (senior team) or inflation | "Walk us through the composition of your team" |

---

### Edge Cases & Escalations (15 minutes)

#### Handling Difficult Cases

**Borderline cases:**
- Present the evidence for both levels
- Ask: "What would tip this clearly one way or the other?"
- If genuine 50/50, default to lower level with clear development plan
- Document the decision and rationale

**Disagreement between managers:**
- Hear both perspectives with specific evidence
- Ask: "What does the job description say?"
- Facilitator or senior leader makes final call if needed
- Document dissenting view

**Special circumstances:**
- Part-time, leave, new role: Calibrate on demonstrated work, note context
- Recent struggles: Separate level (capability) from performance (execution)
- High potential: Potential doesn't change level; level reflects current state

#### Cases to Escalate
Some decisions may need escalation beyond this meeting:
- Level changes with significant compensation implications
- Disagreements that couldn't be resolved
- Patterns suggesting systemic issues
- Cases requiring executive input

Document these and assign owners for follow-up.

---

### Closing (10 minutes)

#### Confirm Decisions
Review and confirm all decisions made:
- Level confirmations
- Level adjustments (up or down)
- Cases needing follow-up

## Calibration Principles Reference

### The Core Question
> "Based on demonstrated outcomes, is this person meeting the expectations for their level as described in the job description?"

### What We Calibrate On

| Calibrate On | Don't Calibrate On |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Demonstrated outcomes | Potential or trajectory |
| Sustained performance | One-time achievements |
| Current capabilities | Past performance at different level |
| Evidence and examples | Manager advocacy or feelings |
| Job description expectations | Comparison to specific individuals |

### Level Indicators

**Signs someone may be under-leveled:**
- Consistently operating above their level's expectations
- Taking on scope typically reserved for higher levels
- Outcomes that would be notable at the next level
- Other teams would level them higher externally

**Signs someone may be over-leveled:**
- Struggling to meet basic expectations for level
- Requiring more support than typical for level
- Outcomes that would be unremarkable at level below
- Wouldn't be hired at this level externally today

### Common Calibration Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Better Approach |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Leveling on tenure | Time doesn't equal capability | Focus on demonstrated outcomes |
| Leveling on potential | Potential isn't performance | Recognize potential through development, not level |
| Comparing to one star | Creates impossible standard | Compare to job description, not individuals |
| Advocacy mode | Undermines objectivity | Present evidence, let group decide |
| Avoiding hard conversations | Creates inequity | Address honestly with kindness |
| Recency bias | Ignores sustained performance | Look at full review period |

## Facilitator Tips

### Before You Facilitate
- Review all materials thoroughly
- Identify likely discussion points in advance
- Prepare probing questions for thin rationales
- Know the job descriptions well
- Have a plan for managing time

### During the Meeting
- Stay neutral; don't advocate for individuals
- Ask clarifying questions
- Summarize and confirm decisions
- Watch for groupthink—invite dissent
- Keep energy and engagement up
- Take breaks for sessions over 2 hours

### Managing Dynamics

**If discussion gets heated:**
- "Let's step back and look at the evidence."
- "What does the job description tell us?"
- "We can disagree respectfully—let's hear both perspectives."

**If someone is dominating:**
- "Thanks, let's hear from others."
- "We've heard your view—any different perspectives?"
- Direct questions to quieter participants.

**If the group is too agreeable:**
- "Anyone see this differently?"
- "Let me play devil's advocate..."
- "What would someone argue for a different level?"

**If you're running behind:**
- Identify which cases truly need discussion
- Use parking lot for complex cases
- Timebox remaining discussions
- Schedule follow-up if needed

### Level Change Communication Template

```
For managers communicating level adjustments:

If level is being adjusted DOWN:

"I want to talk with you about your level in our framework. After our
calibration process, where we ensure consistency across teams, we've
determined that [Level X] is the right level for where you are today.

This is based on [specific evidence/rationale]. I know this may be
disappointing, and I want to be clear: this doesn't change my view of
your value to the team or your potential. It means the expectations
at [higher level] aren't where you're consistently operating yet.

Here's what [higher level] looks like: [brief description]. And here's
what I think we can focus on to help you get there: [development areas].

I'm committed to supporting your growth. Let's talk about what questions
you have and how we can work together on this."

---

If level is being adjusted UP:

"I want to share some good news. After our calibration process, we've
recognized that you've been consistently operating at [new level].

This reflects [specific outcomes and evidence]. You've been demonstrating
[level-appropriate behaviors/outcomes], and we want your level to
accurately reflect that.

Here's what this means going forward: [any implications—comp, expectations].
Congratulations, and thank you for the work you've been doing."
```

## Adapting for Other Calibration Types

### Performance Calibration

**Key differences:**
- Focus on performance rating, not level
- Review performance against level expectations
- Calibrate rating distribution (avoid inflation/deflation)
- Connect to rewards and development

**Additional questions:**
- "Is this performance rating appropriate for someone at this level?"
- "Are we seeing similar performance rated consistently?"
- "Does our rating distribution reflect reality?"

### Promotion Calibration

**Key differences:**
- Focus on readiness for next level
- Higher bar—should be confident, not hopeful
- Use readiness assessments as input
- Consider organizational needs and timing

**Additional questions:**
- "Would we hire this person at the next level externally?"
- "Is this sustained readiness or a recent spike?"
- "Are there gaps we're overlooking?"

### New Hire Calibration

**Key differences:**
- Validate initial leveling after 90-day observation
- Lower stakes—early correction is healthy
- Include hiring manager and current manager

**Additional questions:**
- "Now that we've seen them work, was the level right?"
- "What surprised us relative to the interview?"
- "Any adjustments needed?"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Managers come unprepared | Send reminders, require pre-work submission, follow up individually |
| Same debates every cycle | Document decisions and rationale, reference in future sessions |
| Calibration seen as bureaucracy | Connect to fairness and trust, show impact on decisions |
| Senior leaders exempt themselves | Model from the top, include executives in calibration |
| Decisions not implemented | Track action items, hold managers accountable, follow up |
| Process takes too long | Tighten pre-work requirements, improve facilitation, split into multiple sessions |

### Signs of Healthy Calibration

- Genuine debate on some cases
- Decisions feel fair even when hard
- Managers leave with clearer understanding
- Consistency improves over time
- Employees trust the process
- Framework language becomes common

### Signs of Unhealthy Calibration

- Rubber-stamping without discussion
- Same managers always "winning" debates
- Decisions reversed outside the meeting
- Managers complain process is unfair
- Levels drift without correction
- Framework becomes ignored

## Appendix: Sample Discussion Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tenure vs. Level
> "Jordan has been here 5 years and is still at IC2. They're reliable and do good work, but I'm not seeing IC3-level ownership or scope."

**Discussion points:**
- Is Jordan meeting IC2 expectations? (If yes, that's success)
- What specifically is missing for IC3?
- Is there a development plan, or is IC2 the right long-term level?
- Is Jordan interested in advancing?

### Scenario 2: High Performer, Wrong Level
> "Sam is my best IC3. They're so much better than the other IC3s. Shouldn't they be IC4?"

**Discussion points:**
- "Best IC3" might mean excelling at IC3, not ready for IC4
- What IC4-level outcomes is Sam demonstrating?
- Is Sam impacting beyond their team?
- Compare to IC4 job description, not to other IC3s

### Scenario 3: New to Level
> "Riley was just promoted to IC3 six months ago. They're still learning but showing promise."

**Discussion points:**
- Are they meeting IC3 expectations, even if developing?
- "Learning" at a new level is normal—that's not under-leveled
- What does their trajectory look like?
- Calibrate on current demonstrated capability

### Scenario 4: Different Contexts
> "Morgan is IC3 on the infrastructure team, but infrastructure work is harder. Shouldn't that count for more?"

**Discussion points:**
- Levels should be consistent across teams
- Difficulty of domain is accounted for in expectations
- An IC3 is an IC3, regardless of team
- If infrastructure consistently needs higher levels, that's an org design question
