## Level Context: What IC4 Looks Like

IC4 is a **technical leader with organizational impact** who shapes direction across teams and creates leverage at scale. Evaluate for:

- **Strategic impact** — Identifies and drives high-impact work others haven't recognized
- **Cross-team influence** — Shapes direction without direct authority
- **Force multiplication** — Creates leverage through platforms, practices, or people
- **Technical depth + breadth** — Expert in their domain with broad organizational awareness

**Differentiation from IC3:** IC3 impacts one team; IC4 impacts multiple teams or the organization.
**Differentiation from IC5:** IC4 has organizational impact; IC5 has company-wide and industry impact.

**Note:** IC4 is a senior hire. Look for demonstrated organizational-level impact, not just potential.
