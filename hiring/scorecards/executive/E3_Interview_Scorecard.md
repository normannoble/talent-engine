## Level Context: What CTO Looks Like

The CTO is the **senior-most technology executive** with ultimate accountability for technology strategy, engineering organization, and technical capabilities. Evaluate for:

- **Ultimate accountability** — Owns all technology outcomes; the buck stops here
- **C-level partnership** — Operates as a true peer to CEO, CFO, and board
- **Technology vision** — Sets direction that creates sustainable competitive advantage
- **Organizational builder** — Creates technology organizations recognized for excellence

**Differentiation from E2:** E2 partners with and deputizes for the CTO; CTO owns ultimate technology accountability and represents technology to board and investors.

**Note:** CTO is the most senior technology hire. Look for demonstrated CTO-level impact, board experience, and track record of building exceptional technology organizations.
