- **Executive presence** — Operates as a member of the leadership team, not just a senior manager
- **Developing senior leaders** — Grows M3s toward executive capability
- **Strategic contribution** — Shapes company strategy, not just executes on direction

**Differentiation from M3:** M3 leads engineering capability; E1 owns domain-level business outcomes and operates as an executive.
**Differentiation from E2:** E1 owns a single domain; E2 operates across multiple domains and partners closely with the CTO.

**Note:** E1 is an executive hire. Look for demonstrated executive-level impact, domain accountability, and senior leader development.
