# Interview Scorecard Guide

## Purpose

Interview scorecards ensure consistent, fair, and level-appropriate candidate evaluation. They translate our job descriptions' Success Outcomes and Required Skills into structured interview assessments.

**Scorecards help us:**
- Evaluate candidates against the right level expectations
- Maintain consistency across interviewers and interviews
- Reduce bias by focusing on evidence-based assessment
- Make better hiring decisions with structured data
- Avoid over-leveling or under-leveling candidates

## Core Principles

### 1. Level-Appropriate Evaluation

The same answer may be:
- **Strong** for an IC2 candidate
- **Meeting expectations** for an IC3 candidate
- **Weak** for an IC4 candidate

Always evaluate against the target level, not against some abstract ideal. Reference the job description for what success looks like at that level.

### 2. Evidence-Based Assessment

Every rating must be supported by specific evidence from the interview:
- What the candidate said or did
- Specific examples they provided
- How they approached problems
- Questions they asked

**Avoid:** "Seemed smart" or "Good culture fit" without specifics.

### 3. Focus on Signal, Not Performance

Interviews are artificial situations. Look for signal about how the candidate actually works:
- Problem-solving approach, not just correct answers
- Communication clarity, not polish
- Self-awareness about strengths and gaps
- How they handle ambiguity and feedback

### 4. Calibrate to the Role

Different roles emphasize different competencies:
- **IC roles:** Technical depth, problem-solving, collaboration
- **Management roles:** People leadership, judgment, communication
- **Executive roles:** Strategic thinking, organizational leadership, stakeholder management

## Rating Scale

### Score Definitions

| Score | Label | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | Strong No Hire | Significant concerns; clear evidence candidate cannot succeed at this level |
| **2** | Lean No Hire | Below expectations for the level; gaps in key areas |
| **3** | Neutral | Mixed signals; some strengths, some concerns; need more data |
| **4** | Lean Hire | Meets expectations for the level; solid evidence of capability |
| **5** | Strong Hire | Exceeds expectations for the level; compelling evidence of success |

### Rating Guidance

**Strong No Hire (1):** Use when you have clear evidence the candidate cannot succeed. This isn't about a single mistake—it's about fundamental gaps in required capabilities for the level.

**Lean No Hire (2):** Use when the candidate falls short of level expectations in meaningful ways. They might succeed at a lower level, but not at the target level.

**Neutral (3):** Use sparingly. If you genuinely can't form an opinion, explain why. "Neutral" should prompt additional evaluation, not be a default.

**Lean Hire (4):** Use when the candidate demonstrates solid capability at the target level. They meet expectations and you'd be comfortable working with them.

**Strong Hire (5):** Use when the candidate clearly exceeds level expectations. Reserve this for candidates who would be in the top quartile at this level.

### Avoid Rating Inflation

- **"4" is a positive rating.** It means "yes, hire this person."
- **"5" should be rare.** If everyone is a "5," the scale loses meaning.
- **Be willing to give "2" and "1."** These ratings protect the team from bad hires.

## Scorecard Structure

Each scorecard evaluates candidates across competency areas aligned to the job description:

### IC Scorecards Assess:
1. **Technical Skills** — Core technical competencies for the level
2. **Problem Solving** — Approach to breaking down and solving problems
3. **Communication** — Clarity, listening, ability to explain technical concepts
4. **Collaboration** — Working with others, giving/receiving feedback
5. **Growth & Learning** — Self-awareness, learning orientation, handling feedback

### Management Scorecards Assess:
1. **People Leadership** — Building teams, developing people, handling difficult situations
2. **Technical Judgment** — Ability to guide technical decisions at appropriate altitude
3. **Execution & Delivery** — Planning, prioritization, delivering through teams
4. **Communication & Influence** — Stakeholder management, cross-functional partnership
5. **Growth & Self-Awareness** — Learning orientation, handling feedback, adaptability

### Executive Scorecards Assess:
1. **Strategic Leadership** — Vision, strategic thinking, organizational design
2. **Organizational Impact** — Building capability, developing leaders, scaling teams
3. **Executive Presence** — Board/investor communication, external representation
4. **Technical Credibility** — Appropriate technical engagement for the level
5. **Judgment & Decision-Making** — Handling ambiguity, making high-stakes decisions

## Interview Process

### Recommended Interview Structure

| Interview | Focus | Interviewer |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Recruiter Screen** | Basic qualification, logistics, culture | Recruiter |
| **Hiring Manager Screen** | Role fit, experience, expectations | Hiring Manager |
| **Technical Interview(s)** | Technical skills, problem-solving | Engineers at/above level |
| **Behavioral Interview** | Collaboration, communication, past experiences | Cross-functional or peer |
| **Leadership Interview** (M/E only) | People leadership, strategic thinking | Manager or skip-level |
| **Bar Raiser / Culture** | Overall fit, decision quality | Senior leader outside team |

### Interview Assignment

- **Technical interviewers** should be at or above the candidate's target level
- **Behavioral interviewers** can include cross-functional partners
- **At least one interviewer** should be from outside the immediate team (bar raiser)
- **Diverse interview panels** reduce bias and improve decision quality

## Using the Scorecard

### Before the Interview

1. **Review the job description** for the target level
2. **Review the scorecard** and understand what you're evaluating
3. **Prepare questions** that will give you signal on each competency
4. **Review the candidate's resume** but stay open-minded

### During the Interview

1. **Take detailed notes** — Capture what the candidate says, not just your reactions
2. **Ask follow-up questions** — Dig into specifics, examples, and reasoning
3. **Leave time for candidate questions** — Their questions reveal priorities and judgment
4. **Stay on your assigned competencies** — Trust other interviewers to cover their areas

### After the Interview

1. **Complete the scorecard immediately** — Don't wait; memory fades quickly
2. **Provide specific evidence** — For each rating, explain what drove it
3. **Rate independently** — Don't discuss with other interviewers before submitting
4. **Submit before the debrief** — Avoid groupthink and anchoring

---

## Debrief Process

### Before the Debrief

- All interviewers submit scorecards
- Hiring manager reviews for completeness
- Identify areas of agreement and disagreement

### During the Debrief

1. **Quick round-robin:** Each interviewer shares their overall recommendation (hire/no hire) without explanation
2. **Discuss disagreements:** Focus on areas where ratings diverge significantly
3. **Share evidence:** What specific things did the candidate say or do?
4. **Recalibrate if needed:** It's OK to adjust ratings based on new information
5. **Make a decision:** Hire, no hire, or additional interviews needed

### Decision Framework

| Scenario | Typical Outcome |
|----------|-----------------|
| All 4s and 5s | Strong hire |
| Mix of 4s with one 3 | Likely hire; discuss the concern |
| Multiple 3s | Additional interviews or no hire |
| Any 1 or 2 | Serious discussion; usually no hire |
| Strong disagreement | Dig into the evidence; may need additional signal |

### Red Flags That Override Positive Signals

- Integrity concerns (dishonesty, misrepresentation)
- Inability to collaborate or receive feedback
- Lack of self-awareness about significant gaps
- Values misalignment
- Concerning references

## Level Calibration

### How to Calibrate

When evaluating, always ask: **"Is this answer/behavior strong for the target level?"**

**Example: Technical Problem-Solving**

| Level | Expectation |
|-------|-------------|
| IC1 | Works through the problem with guidance; asks good questions; learns from hints |
| IC2 | Solves straightforward problems independently; may need help on edge cases |
| IC3 | Solves complex problems independently; considers edge cases; explains trade-offs |
| IC4 | Identifies the right problem to solve; considers system-wide implications; elegant solutions |
| IC5 | Reframes problems in novel ways; anticipates future needs; solutions others wouldn't think of |

**Example: Leadership (Management)**

| Level | Expectation |
|-------|-------------|
| M1 | Has ideas about management; learning orientation; reasonable instincts |
| M2 | Proven track record; handles complex situations; operates independently |
| M3 | Develops other managers; shapes culture; strategic organizational thinking |

### Common Calibration Mistakes

**Over-leveling:** Rating IC3-quality answers as IC4/IC5 because they're "good"
- *Fix:* Ask "Would this stand out among current IC4s?"

**Under-leveling:** Expecting IC3 depth from IC1/IC2 candidates
- *Fix:* Reference the job description for what's actually expected

**Wrong dimension:** Strong technical skills compensating for weak collaboration
- *Fix:* Rate each competency independently

**Interview performance vs. job performance:** Penalizing interview nerves
- *Fix:* Look for signal, not polish

## Bias Mitigation

### Common Biases in Interviews

| Bias | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Halo Effect** | One strong area colors entire evaluation | Rate each competency independently |
| **Horn Effect** | One weak area colors entire evaluation | Rate each competency independently |
| **Similarity Bias** | Preferring candidates like yourself | Focus on evidence, not style |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seeking evidence to confirm initial impression | Challenge your first impression |
| **Anchoring** | Over-weighting early information | Consider the full interview |
| **Recency Bias** | Over-weighting recent information | Review notes from full interview |

### Structured Mitigation

1. **Use scorecards consistently** — Same criteria for all candidates
2. **Rate before discussing** — Independent assessment before debrief
3. **Focus on evidence** — Specific examples, not impressions
4. **Diverse panels** — Multiple perspectives reduce individual bias
5. **Calibrate regularly** — Team discussions on what "good" looks like

## Leveling Decisions

### Determining the Right Level

Sometimes candidates are strong but at a different level than targeted. Consider:

1. **Is the candidate clearly above or below the target level?**
2. **Do we have headcount at that level?**
3. **Would the candidate accept an offer at that level?**
4. **Can we provide appropriate scope and growth?**

### Level Adjustment Guidance

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Candidate exceeds target level | Discuss up-leveling if headcount exists |
| Candidate below target level | Consider lower level if role exists and candidate would accept |
| Candidate between levels | Default to lower level; better to exceed expectations than struggle |
| Unclear on level | Additional interviews focused on level-differentiating questions |

### Avoiding Mis-Leveling

**Over-leveling risks:**
- Candidate struggles to meet expectations
- Team frustrated with underperformance
- Difficult performance conversations
- May lead to termination

**Under-leveling risks:**
- Candidate feels undervalued
- Flight risk once they realize
- May decline offer
- Competitor may offer higher level

**When in doubt:** Level conservatively. It's easier to promote a high performer than to manage out someone who was over-leveled.

## Summary

Effective interviewing requires:

1. **Level-appropriate evaluation** — Same answer means different things at different levels
2. **Evidence-based assessment** — Specific examples, not impressions
3. **Structured process** — Scorecards, independent rating, calibrated debriefs
4. **Bias awareness** — Active mitigation of common interview biases
5. **Clear decisions** — Hire, no hire, or get more data

The goal is to identify candidates who will succeed at the target level—not to find perfect candidates or to make candidates feel good. A rigorous, fair process serves everyone: the candidate, the team, and the company.
