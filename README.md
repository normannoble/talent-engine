# Talent Engine: Outcome-Based Career Framework

A comprehensive career progression framework for Product, Design, and Technology organizations. Built on the principle that **levels describe what success looks like, not just years of experience or task lists.**

---

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository contains a complete talent management system including:

- **Leveling Frameworks** – Two approaches (Composable and Traditional) for defining career levels
- **Job Descriptions** – Outcome-based JDs for all IC, Management, and Executive levels
- **Career Development Tools** – Progression guides and readiness assessments for every transition
- **Performance Management** – Philosophy, guidelines, and assessment templates for all levels
- **Templates & Tools** – Resources for creating new JDs and extending the framework

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Understanding the System

Start here to understand the philosophy and approach:

1. **[Job Descriptions vs Job Ads](frameworks/Job_Descriptions_vs_Job_Ads.md)** – Understand the critical distinction
2. Choose your framework approach:
   - **[Composable Framework](frameworks/Composable_Leveling_Framework.md)** – ICxMy system (e.g., IC3M1)
   - **[Traditional Framework](frameworks/Traditional_Leveling_Framework.md)** – Separate IC and Management tracks
3. Review example job descriptions in `job-descriptions/`

### For Finding Role Expectations

**Looking for a specific role?** Go to `job-descriptions/[track]/` and open the relevant level:

- **Individual Contributors**: `job-descriptions/ic/`
- **People Managers**: `job-descriptions/management/`
- **Executives**: `job-descriptions/executive/`

### For Career Development

**Planning your growth?** Start in `career-development/`:

1. Read the **Career Overview** for your track in `overviews/`
2. Review the **Progression Guide** for your target transition in `progression-guides/`
3. When ready, use the **Readiness Assessment** in `readiness-assessments/`

### For Creating New Job Descriptions

1. Review the **[Standardized Job Description Template](templates/Standardized_Job_Description_Template.md)**
2. Use the **[JD Creation Assistant](templates/JD_Creation_Assistant.md)** guidelines
3. Reference existing JDs as examples

## 📖 Core Documents

### Frameworks
- **[Composable Leveling Framework](frameworks/Composable_Leveling_Framework.md)** – ICxMy system treating IC and Management as composable dimensions
- **[Traditional Leveling Framework](frameworks/Traditional_Leveling_Framework.md)** – Conventional IC1-5 and M1-3 tracks
- **[Job Descriptions vs Job Ads](frameworks/Job_Descriptions_vs_Job_Ads.md)** – Why these are fundamentally different artifacts

### Performance Management
- **[Performance Management Philosophy](performance-management/Performance_Management_Philosophy.md)** – Core principles for evaluation and feedback
- **Assessment Templates** – Self, peer, and manager assessments for all levels:
  - `performance-management/templates/ic/` – IC1-IC5 assessments
  - `performance-management/templates/management/` – M1-M3 assessments
  - `performance-management/templates/executive/` – E1-E3 assessments

### Templates
- **[Standardized Job Description Template](templates/Standardized_Job_Description_Template.md)** – Template for creating new JDs
- **[JD Creation Assistant](templates/JD_Creation_Assistant.md)** – Guidelines for systematic JD creation

## 🎯 Philosophy

### Outcome-Based Success Definition

Job descriptions define success through **outcomes** (desired end states), not **activities** (task lists):

**Instead of:** "Manage the product roadmap"  
**We write:** "A product roadmap that is clearly prioritized, aligned with company strategy, and understood by stakeholders"

**Instead of:** "Lead engineering team"  
**We write:** "A high-performing engineering team that consistently delivers quality work and meets commitments"

### Key Principles

1. **Outcomes over tasks** – Describe what success looks like, not what activities to perform
2. **Level-appropriate expectations** – Same outcome may be IC3 for one person, IC4 for another
3. **Cumulative competencies** – Higher levels build on lower level foundations
4. **Multiple valid paths** – Plateauing at IC3 or M2 represents strong career success
5. **Promotion = sustained performance** – Must demonstrate next-level work before promotion

- **Conduct reviews**: Use assessment templates in `performance-management/templates/` for structured evaluations
- **Maintain consistency**: Reference framework during performance reviews and calibration

### For HR/People Ops

- **Hire accurately**: Use JDs to write job ads and evaluate candidates
- **Level consistently**: Apply framework criteria across hiring and promotions
- **Develop people**: Use progression guides in career development programs
- **Run performance cycles**: Use the performance management philosophy and templates
- **Extend the framework**: Use templates to create JDs for new roles or functions

### For Organizations Adopting This Framework

1. Review both framework approaches (Composable vs Traditional)
2. Choose which approach fits your organizational needs
3. Customize engineering examples for your tech stack if needed
4. Map existing roles to framework levels
5. Train managers on the framework and its application
6. Integrate into performance management and promotion processes
7. Expand to other functions (Product, Design, etc.) as needed
