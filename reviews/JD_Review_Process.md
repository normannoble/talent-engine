# JD Review Process

## Overview

This document outlines the standard process for reviewing Job Descriptions against the Talent Engine framework.

---

## Process Steps

### 1. Submit JD for Review

- Provide the original JD as a PDF file
- Note the source/requester
- Clarify any context (e.g., urgency, specific concerns, hiring timeline)

### 2. Initial Analysis

The reviewer will assess the JD against framework principles:

- **Document Type**: Is this a Job Description (internal) or Job Ad (external)?
- **Level Assessment**: What level does this role represent (IC1-5, M1-3, E1-3)?
- **Outcome vs Activity**: Are responsibilities written as outcomes or tasks?
- **Clarity**: Are expectations clear and measurable?
- **Completeness**: Are scope, autonomy, and success criteria defined?
- **Alignment**: Does it align with framework philosophy?

### 3. Clarifying Questions

**If discrepancies or ambiguities are found, the reviewer must ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**

Common discrepancies requiring clarification:
- Title mismatch (filename vs content)
- Level ambiguity (experience vs responsibilities)
- Role confusion (e.g., SRE vs Cloud Engineer vs Platform Engineer)
- Core skills listed as "nice to have"
- Unclear reporting structure or team context

The reviewer should not assume answers — get explicit confirmation from the requester.

### 4. Review Discussion

Once clarifications are received, the reviewer will present findings:

- Key issues identified
- Recommended level
- Suggested improvements

**The review findings must be agreed upon before proceeding.**

### 5. Document Creation

Once review outcomes are agreed, the following are created:

| Document | Format | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Original | .pdf | The submitted JD (unchanged) |
| Review | .docx | Analysis, issues, and recommendations |
| Suggested Improvement | .docx | Outcome-based rewrite following framework |

### 6. Package & Deliver

All documents are packaged into a ZIP file:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_Title_From_JD/
├── Original.pdf
├── Review.docx
├── Suggested_Improvement.docx
└── YYYY-MM-DD_Title_From_JD_Package.zip
```

## Review Criteria

### Outcome-Based Language

| Avoid (Activity) | Use (Outcome) |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Manage the roadmap" | "A roadmap that is prioritized and aligned with strategy" |
| "Write code" | "Code that is clean, tested, and maintainable" |
| "Lead meetings" | "Meetings that drive decisions and clear next steps" |
| "Support the team" | "A team that has what they need to deliver" |

### Level Indicators

| Level | Typical Markers |
|-------|-----------------|
| IC1 | Learning, shadowing, close guidance, 0-1 years |
| IC2 | Independent on defined tasks, owns components, 1-3 years |
| IC3 | Owns complex systems, mentors others, technical leadership, 3-6 years |
| IC4 | Cross-team impact, sets standards, strategic influence, 6-10 years |
| IC5 | Organization-wide impact, industry recognition, 10+ years |

### Red Flags

- Heavy use of "assist," "support," "help" (unclear ownership)
- No success criteria or outcomes defined
- Title doesn't match responsibilities
- "Nice to have" contains core skills for the role
- Experience requirements misaligned with expectations
- No scope or autonomy defined

## Questions to Clarify

Before finalizing a review, consider asking:

1. Is this an internal JD or external job ad?
2. What level is intended?
3. What team/function will this role join?
4. What does success look like in 6-12 months?
5. What decisions can this role make independently?
6. Who does this role report to?
