# Annual Review Process Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the end-to-end process for conducting performance reviews. Our framework uses a **semi-annual review cycle** with comprehensive evaluations twice per year, supplemented by quarterly check-ins for ongoing alignment.

The annual review process ensures:
- Consistent, fair evaluation across the organization
- Clear connection between performance and career outcomes
- Actionable development planning
- Appropriate recognition and compensation decisions

---

## Phase 1: Preparation (2 weeks before review period)

### HR/People Ops Actions

- [ ] Announce review cycle timeline to all employees and managers
- [ ] Distribute templates (self-assessment, peer assessment, manager assessment)
- [ ] Schedule calibration sessions
- [ ] Send reminder communications
- [ ] Prepare any system access or tools needed

### Manager Actions

- [ ] Review direct reports' job descriptions and level expectations
- [ ] Gather notes and documentation from the review period
- [ ] Review previous review and quarterly check-in notes
- [ ] Identify peer reviewers for each direct report (in collaboration with employee)
- [ ] Block time for assessment writing and review conversations

### Employee Actions

- [ ] Review your job description's Success Outcomes
- [ ] Gather documentation of your accomplishments (projects, metrics, feedback)
- [ ] Nominate 3-5 peers for peer feedback
- [ ] Block time for thoughtful self-assessment completion

---

## Phase 2: Self-Assessment (1 week)

### Purpose

The self-assessment provides the employee's perspective on their performance. It captures:
- Accomplishments and impact from the employee's viewpoint
- Context that only the employee has visibility into
- Honest reflection on development areas
- Career direction and development goals

### Process

1. **Employee completes self-assessment** using the level-appropriate template
2. **Employee submits to manager** by the deadline
3. **Manager reviews** to understand employee's perspective before writing their assessment

### Guidelines for Employees

**Do:**
- Be specific—use concrete examples with measurable outcomes where possible
- Be balanced—acknowledge both strengths and areas for growth
- Reference your job description's Success Outcomes directly
- Include context that your manager may not have visibility into
- Be honest about challenges and development areas

**Don't:**
- Write a resume—focus on impact, not just activities
- Be falsely modest—accurately represent your contributions
- Exaggerate or inflate—credibility matters
- Wait until the last minute—thoughtful reflection takes time

### Quality Check

A good self-assessment includes:
- [ ] Specific examples for each Success Outcome area
- [ ] Honest self-ratings with supporting evidence
- [ ] Acknowledgment of development areas
- [ ] Clear articulation of career direction
- [ ] Specific requests for support

---

## Phase 3: Peer Assessment (1 week, overlapping with self-assessment)

### Purpose

Peer feedback provides perspectives that managers may not directly observe:
- Day-to-day collaboration quality
- Technical contributions and reliability
- How the person shows up as a teammate
- Blind spots the employee may not see

### Peer Selection Process

1. **Employee nominates 3-5 peers** who have meaningful collaboration experience
2. **Manager reviews nominations** and may suggest additions or substitutions
3. **Final list should include:**
   - People with genuine working relationships (not just friendly colleagues)
   - Diverse perspectives (different projects, functions, or contexts)
   - At least one person who can speak to development areas (not just praise)

### Process

1. **Manager sends peer assessment requests** with deadline
2. **Peers complete assessments** focusing on:
   - Where the person performs well against their role expectations
   - Where opportunities exist for development or improvement
3. **Manager receives and synthesizes** peer feedback
4. **Manager summarizes themes** (not verbatim quotes) for review conversation

### Guidelines for Peer Reviewers

**Do:**
- Be specific—provide concrete examples
- Be constructive—focus on behaviors and work, not personality
- Be honest—vague praise isn't helpful; real feedback enables growth
- Reference the person's job description when assessing performance
- Only comment on areas where you have direct observation

**Don't:**
- Use this as a vehicle for grievances or personal issues
- Provide only positive feedback if development areas exist
- Comment on things you haven't directly observed
- Share your feedback with the person being reviewed (manager will synthesize)

### Confidentiality

- Peer identities are not disclosed to the employee
- Manager summarizes themes without verbatim attribution
- Peers should feel safe providing honest feedback

---

## Phase 4: Manager Assessment (1 week)

### Purpose

The manager assessment synthesizes all inputs into a coherent, calibrated evaluation:
- Self-assessment perspective
- Peer feedback themes
- Manager's direct observations
- Level-appropriate expectations

### Process

1. **Review all inputs:**
   - Employee's self-assessment
   - Peer feedback (look for patterns and themes)
   - Your own notes and observations from the period
   - Previous review and quarterly check-in notes

2. **Complete manager assessment template:**
   - Evaluate each Success Outcome area with evidence
   - Assign ratings based on level expectations
   - Note development areas and recommendations
   - Draft talking points for the review conversation

3. **Prepare for calibration:**
   - Identify any borderline ratings that may need discussion
   - Gather evidence to support your assessments
   - Note any exceptional circumstances or context

### Rating Guidelines

| Rating | When to Use | Evidence Required |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Exceptional** | Truly rare, outstanding performance well beyond level | Multiple significant examples of extraordinary impact |
| **Exceeds Expectation** | Consistently performing above level; showing next-level capability | Pattern of above-level delivery over the period |
| **Meets Expectation** | Solidly achieving Success Outcomes for the level | Evidence of consistent delivery against JD outcomes |
| **Below Expectation** | Falling short in meaningful ways; gaps in key areas | Specific examples of gaps; should not be a surprise |
| **Unsatisfactory** | Significantly below expectations; core outcomes not achieved | Clear pattern of underperformance; likely already on PIP |

### Synthesizing Divergent Perspectives

When self, peer, and manager perspectives differ:

- **Self rates higher than manager:** Explore in conversation—may indicate blind spots or context you're missing
- **Peers rate higher than manager:** Consider if you lack visibility into certain contributions
- **Peers rate lower than self/manager:** May indicate collaboration issues not visible elsewhere

Document your reasoning when your assessment differs significantly from other inputs.

---

## Phase 5: Calibration (1-2 sessions)

### Purpose

Calibration ensures consistent standards across managers and teams:
- Same performance gets same rating, regardless of manager
- Level expectations are applied consistently
- Promotion candidates are evaluated fairly
- Rating inflation/deflation is identified and corrected

### Calibration Session Structure

**Attendees:** Managers at the same level (e.g., all M1s with their M2, or all M2s with M3)

**Duration:** 2-3 hours per session (may need multiple sessions for large orgs)

**Facilitation:** Senior leader or HR partner

### Process

1. **Pre-work:** Managers submit proposed ratings before the session

2. **Review distribution:** Facilitator shows rating distribution across teams
   - Flag unusual distributions (all high, all low, no differentiation)
   - Compare to expected healthy distribution

3. **Discuss borderline cases:**
   - Focus on employees rated Exceeds or Below Expectation
   - Manager presents rating with evidence
   - Group discusses and may adjust
   - Goal is consistency, not consensus on every rating

4. **Promotion candidates:**
   - Review all employees with repeated Exceeds ratings
   - Discuss readiness for formal Readiness Assessment
   - Align on who should be considered for promotion

5. **Document decisions:**
   - Record any rating changes and rationale
   - Note action items for follow-up

### Calibration Ground Rules

- **Evidence-based:** Opinions must be supported by examples
- **Level-appropriate:** Always ask "Is this strong for their level?"
- **Respectful:** Critique the assessment, not the manager
- **Confidential:** What's discussed stays in the room
- **Action-oriented:** Decisions are made, not deferred

### Common Calibration Issues

| Issue | Signs | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Rating inflation | Most ratings are Exceeds or Exceptional | Recalibrate to JD expectations; ask "What would Meets look like?" |
| Central tendency | Almost everyone is Meets Expectation | Require differentiation; identify top and bottom performers |
| Inconsistent standards | Same performance rated differently across teams | Align on specific examples of each rating |
| Recency bias | Ratings driven by recent events | Ask for evidence from full period |
| Level confusion | IC2 rated against IC3 expectations | Always reference the person's actual level JD |

## Phase 6: Review Delivery (1-2 weeks)

### Purpose

The review conversation is where the assessment is shared, discussed, and converted into action. It should feel like a dialogue, not a verdict.

### Pre-Conversation Preparation

**Manager:**
- [ ] Finalize assessment after calibration
- [ ] Prepare talking points for each section
- [ ] Anticipate questions or pushback
- [ ] Schedule 60-90 minutes in a private setting
- [ ] Have development resources ready (progression guides, etc.)

**Employee:**
- [ ] Review your self-assessment
- [ ] Prepare questions
- [ ] Come with an open mind

### Conversation Structure (60-90 minutes)

**1. Opening (5 minutes)**
- Set a collaborative tone
- Explain the conversation structure
- Acknowledge this is a two-way dialogue

**2. Overall Assessment (10 minutes)**
- Share overall rating and summary
- Highlight key themes
- Acknowledge strengths first

**3. Detailed Discussion (30-40 minutes)**
- Walk through each Success Outcome area
- Share rating, evidence, and observations
- Invite employee response and context
- Discuss peer feedback themes (without attribution)
- Address any divergence between self-assessment and manager assessment

**4. Development Planning (15-20 minutes)**
- Discuss development areas and recommendations
- Connect to progression guides if pursuing next level
- Identify specific development actions
- Discuss support and resources needed

**5. Career Conversation (10 minutes)**
- Discuss career direction and goals
- Address promotion path if relevant
- Align on next steps

**6. Close (5 minutes)**
- Summarize key takeaways
- Confirm action items
- Set follow-up expectations
- Thank them for their contributions

### Handling Difficult Conversations

**When delivering Below Expectation or Unsatisfactory ratings:**

- Be direct but compassionate—don't soften the message until it's lost
- Lead with specific examples, not generalizations
- This should NOT be a surprise—issues should have been raised in real-time
- Focus on path forward, not just what went wrong
- Have a clear plan (development plan or PIP as appropriate)
- Allow time for the employee to process and respond
- Document the conversation

**When the employee disagrees:**

- Listen fully to their perspective
- Acknowledge their viewpoint
- Explain your reasoning with evidence
- You don't have to agree, but you should understand each other
- If truly new information emerges, it's OK to say you'll reflect further
- Ultimately, the manager's assessment stands (unless escalated)

### Documentation

After the conversation:
- [ ] Finalize written assessment with any updates from discussion
- [ ] Document key discussion points and agreements
- [ ] Record action items and development commitments
- [ ] Employee signs acknowledging receipt (not necessarily agreement)
- [ ] File in appropriate HR system

---

## Phase 7: Follow-Through

### Immediate Actions (Within 1 week)

- [ ] Process any compensation changes
- [ ] Initiate Readiness Assessments for promotion candidates
- [ ] Create or update development plans
- [ ] Schedule follow-up for anyone on improvement plan
- [ ] Send calendar invites for quarterly check-ins

### Ongoing Actions

- [ ] Reference review outcomes in regular 1:1s
- [ ] Track progress on development commitments
- [ ] Provide real-time feedback (don't save for next review)
- [ ] Document performance throughout the period
- [ ] Address issues early—don't wait for next review

### Triggering Next Steps

| Review Outcome | Next Step |
|----------------|-----------|
| Two consecutive Exceeds ratings | Initiate formal Readiness Assessment |
| Below Expectation | Create focused development plan; increase check-in frequency |
| Unsatisfactory | Initiate Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with HR |
| Employee interested in promotion | Review progression guide together; identify development focus |
| Employee satisfied at current level | Focus on mastery and engagement; recognize sustained excellence |

## Common Questions

### Timing and Process

**Q: What if someone joined mid-period?**
A: Conduct a review covering the time they've been in role. Adjust expectations appropriately for ramp-up time. Note the limited observation period in the assessment.

**Q: What if someone changed roles or levels mid-period?**
A: Evaluate against expectations for each role proportionally. Be clear about which expectations applied when.

**Q: What if a manager changed mid-period?**
A: New manager should gather input from previous manager. Focus on what new manager has observed, supplemented by peer feedback and previous manager's notes.

### Ratings and Outcomes

**Q: Can someone be promoted with a Meets Expectation rating?**
A: No. Promotion requires demonstrated above-level performance (Exceeds Expectation) sustained over time. Meets Expectation means performing well at current level—which is good, but not promotion-ready.

**Q: What's the difference between Exceeds and Exceptional?**
A: Exceeds means consistently performing above your current level—showing next-level capability. Exceptional is reserved for truly rare, extraordinary performance that stands out across the organization. Most strong performers will be Meets or Exceeds.

**Q: Do ratings directly determine compensation?**
A: Ratings inform compensation decisions but don't mechanically determine them. Other factors include market rates, internal equity, budget, and tenure. That said, higher ratings should result in meaningfully higher compensation outcomes.

### Development and Career

**Q: What if an employee disagrees with their rating?**
A: Listen to their perspective and explain your reasoning. You don't have to agree, but you should understand each other. If they want to formally dispute, follow your organization's escalation process.

**Q: How do I handle someone who isn't interested in promotion?**
A: That's completely valid. Focus on continued excellence at their current level, deepening mastery, and maintaining engagement. Compensation can grow within levels for sustained strong performance.

**Q: What triggers a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)?**
A: An Unsatisfactory rating, or a pattern of Below Expectation ratings without improvement despite feedback and support. PIPs should be created in partnership with HR and represent a genuine opportunity to improve.
