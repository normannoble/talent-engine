## Quarterly Check-in Best Practices

### For Employees

- **Prepare in advance** — Don't wing it; thoughtful preparation makes the conversation more valuable
- **Be honest** — This is a safe space for course correction; surface issues early
- **Own your development** — Come with ideas for how you want to grow
- **Ask for what you need** — Managers can't help if they don't know

### For Managers

- **Listen more than talk** — This is the employee's time to share their perspective
- **Focus on support** — How can you help them succeed?
- **Address concerns early** — Don't wait for formal reviews to raise issues
- **Follow through** — If you commit to something, do it
- **Keep it lightweight** — This isn't a formal review; keep the tone conversational

### What This Is NOT

- ❌ A formal performance review
- ❌ A compensation discussion
- ❌ A promotion decision
- ❌ A documentation exercise for HR
- ❌ A one-way status report

### What This IS

- ✓ A two-way conversation about progress and alignment
- ✓ An early warning system for issues
- ✓ A development and support check-in
- ✓ A goal alignment and adjustment opportunity
- ✓ A relationship-building touchpoint
